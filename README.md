My personal blog.

The theme I'm using is a slightly modified verion of <a href="https://adueck.github.io/good-clean-read/">Good Clean Read</a>, by [Adam Dueck](https://github.com/adueck/good-clean-read), which is built on top of <a href="http://chibicode.github.io/solo">Solo</a>, by [Shu Uesugi](https://github.com/chibicode).
