title: "Soulless coffee"
---

Mornings would feel more post-apocalyptic if there wasn't a coffee shop across the street. It's the drive-thru that feels anachronistic. Reason being that a world after nuclear annihilation would most definitely have developed the means to produce coffee. Enterprising business people would find a way. They are like the undead. Kill one and ten others pop out of their graves. Clearly coffee is the safe and lucrative choice in this new world. You can't go wrong. Because you know. You've seen the future.

Every Wednesday Mason and Charles meet for coffee in front of the Amish furniture mega-store before dawn. They sit on the lawn chairs outside and sip their coffees tentatively until the morning air cools their brews. They prefer the privacy and account for the cold by wearing jackets. Mason also wears a beanie to cover his wombat-esque ears and shaved head.

The thing about this coffee shop is that it's too cozy. The chairs are leather and stuffed with feathers and so comfortable that people don't care how many bison and geese it takes to create something this decadent. You sit in one and you won't want to move. You just release yourself and sink in. And if you're lucky enough to own a 10G cellular implant, maybe you order a movie to be streamed instantly to your brain for five bucks.

The other thing is the arrangement of tables and chairs are an inch too close and makes it feel like the person one table over is actually part of your party. The general trend is to sit at every other table or every other chair. People will get "table rage" if someone sits two over because that decreases room capacity and it's this kind of unsaid courtesy and not doing so is a big fuck you to everyone who has by default opted-in so to say. Luckily fights at coffee shops usually are just two people shouting about rules and personal freedom and shit. They may even shove each other, but there's no fists or knives or broken tables or people trying to throw karate kicks.

The music this coffee shop plays is this dissonant violin music where there must be an army of violinists shredding random Van Halen licks at 300nps. This morning they are playing the unplugged version, which is just as terrifying if not more than the plugged-in version with distortion and reverb effects. Most of the current crop of violinists are ex-gamers who've honed their skills on plastic-buttoned guitars and can play long sequences of notes with frightening accuracy and speed and who soon found the market for guitarists was saturated and super competitive and the only recourse for their skills on the occupational roadmap was data entry. That was until some classical music aficionado and number twenty ranked Guitar Hero in the world composed what would be the first post-violin-flashback-rock piece titled Flight of a Thousand Bumble Bees, of which he'd actually created on the game's level editor during an all-night RockStar binge. The result was a modest emulation of about twenty bumble bees, which was satisfactory for his practice needs and he was in no way even consciously trying to create a new musical genre as a so-called "escape-hatch" for the dreaded Post-Guitar-Hero-Syndrome (PGHS) that afflicts 80% in the professional circuit before age seventeen. PGHS is basically this realization that he or she has wasted five years of their childhood basically practicing to become a highly specialized robot that can play cover tunes, and to make things worse, they can't ever beat a real robot's perfect mechanics and rhythm.

Outside, the sound of cars and trucks speeding down a pot-holed highway is only slightly more tolerable than this post-violin-flashback-rock that is finding airtime everywhere. Both render Mason unable to think or concentrate. The noise makes his brain hurt worse than when he is actually thinking. Charles tells Mason that his sense for the hip is starting to fail him. It's no different than how he probably can't run as fast or jump as high as two years ago and maybe he even wakes up with creaky knees on cold mornings.

This Amish lawn furniture is comfortable. People have rocked themselves to sleep and had to have sales people with Abraham Lincoln beard-wigs shake them up and escort their groggy carcasses to their cars at closing time. Lately Amish Furniture Collective (AFC) has been the subject of a handful of investigative reports, all of which originate from the "Footstools are sold separately!" scandal, which brought to the national spotlight the question of whether the company's furniture is handmade and painted in Amish collectives in Pennsylvania as the company's corporate alibi goes or not. The reports all suggest that the company's perfection and attention to minutiae is actually the product of a Toyota inspired assembly line. Then last week, a sales associate, who wishes to remain anonymous and is going under the pseudonym of "Zeke," recalled how every morning at the crack of the rooster's howl, he was forced to take out the lawn chairs and then string this heavy-duty Kevlar cable around all the armrests and then hook and lock the latching end to the building. One of the pull-quotes in the article, which Mason can't seem to shake, is this, 'He told me to remove my deer-hide gloves. And then he wrapped my fingers one-by-one around the cord. The Kevlar was so smooth. I couldn't believe it.'

RHK Strikes Again. This is the headline on every paper in the United States this morning. This is what sleepy-eyed citizens in slippers and robes will find on their doorstep. The victim was found with a bloodied herring in her mouth. Her eyes are held open by little snapped off herring toes. The bruises on her forearms look like black clouds in the photograph. If you take out the whole bird-stuffed-beak-first-in-mouth macabre, this "Red Herring Killer" is incredibly precise in how he presents his victims. The police don't even question the boyfriend this time even though security footage analysis say he was possibly at Pet Smart three days earlier.

'You should read the sports section. Or better yet the A&E. They're doing a month long feature on that 'Journey to the West' musical,' Charles says. As a mentor, he is pretty epigrammatic. He prefers riddles and non sequiturs to military style indoctrination tactics. Most of the time he comes off as not caring one iota about his mentoring duties or journalism. But yet he's here every Wednesday to answer Mason's questions without really answering them.

'I watched the original TV series before we became part of the Chinese Republic.'

'Here, take half of the sports section.' He hands Mason the tennis and bowling scores pages. 'I need it back though. There's an article on heat-seeking bowling balls.'

'I hear it's in Guinness for longest musical.'

'Thirty days. People have died in there.'

'A few exploding bladders too.'

'A woman gave birth to quintuplets.'

'Didn't the Chinese say it was a sign of prosperity?'

'Good fortune, I think. Lucky number seven.'

‘I can see why the Chinese like casinos.’

‘It’s brilliant, opening all these casinos here. They’re opening one next to the Golden Gate this weekend. Its got Mongolian BBQ instead of your typical pseudo-International hodgepodge of dishes you might find in a Vegas buffet. There’s a great review in A&E today.’ Charles puts the newspaper on the table that sits between their lawn chairs and which is level with the armrests.

The mentoring session ends when they are both finished with their coffees. This is their deal, their arrangement. It makes something mandatory feel less mandatory, as if they are meeting as friends and not out of company policy and contractual obligation to Media News Corp.

Mason finishes first as always, gulping the last few ounces and then smashing the cup down so a small watery circle forms on the newspaper. Little flagella of water smears the text in a southeast direction. He keeps his hand clasped and then crushes the reinforced paper cup’s body until the plastic driving lid pops off and sits in a tenuous angle on the now oval cup lip.

Charles drinks his coffee with restraint. He starts by taking off the lid and placing it upside-down so all the little steam bubbles are visible. He finds that coffee cools down faster this way. He likes his coffee soulless. He coined this term himself and describes it as minimal caffeine but not decaf, unsweetened, moist-soil-brown in complexion and with a higher concentration of hot water, and finally the brew is not consumable until the morning air cools it naturally and leaves the coffee tepid and void of steam. Only then does he begin his cycle of reading a few paragraphs and then taking a sip.

Mason doesn’t believe in souls or heaven or anything, but when he watches the tendrils of steam rising into the atmosphere, he imagines that this is what the journey to the netherworld would look like, invisible tubes sucking your soul right out of you.
