title: "The debauchee"
---

The spandex has deformed her breasts into irregular and asymmetrical tumors on her chest. A perceptive observer or a person of close relation to this woman will also notice that her legs are bowed slightly inwards at the point where her calf and thigh meet her kneecap. Her movements on the elliptical resemble a fleeing ostrich or the prancing of a small biped dinosaur. She wears earbuds. The tangle of cords, if you follow them from her ears, leads to a portable music device attached to her wrist via Velcro and a snug pocket.

She exercises at 24 Hour Fitness from 11PM to 1AM to avoid the crowds of health conscious men and women who make her nervous and too aware of her own grotesque body image. The single drawback to her late night workouts is not drowsiness – like she has never fallen asleep on the elliptical, smashed her face into the control panel, and gotten herself tangled in the ergonomic footpads and handlebars – but the occasional pervert who decides to ogle her from outside the glass walls of the gym.

Tonight is no different. For the last half hour this 'debauchee', as she likes to call him, has been watching her. She finds the lack of expression in his face serial-killer-scary, reminds her of Jason Voorhees and the 'Friday the Thirteenth' movies she found so frightening when she was younger. Even though it is now 1:15AM she continues to exercise on the elliptical, except now she moves at a more lethargic pace due to growing fatigue and drowsiness. Her mind keeps drifting into fantasy, into scenarios involving the debauchee and what she believes is her impending death, her future if she ever leaves this building tonight: the debauchee stabs her in the back with his hunting knife, the debauchee severs her head by manually rolling up the driver's seat window of her 89' Honda Civic, etcetera.

She gets to the point where the violence in her mind becomes so terrifying that she calls the police. But for now, while she waits, she closes her eyes under the belief that what she cannot see does not exist.
