title:  "The shape of stone"

Karl's hands were a "de-evolution" so to say. His left hand was a horse hoof powerful enough to bust someone's face open if they pissed him off. That was why, as a child, his high school boxing coach wanted him in the ring. "With a hoof like that, you could be State Champion, kid." The other hand was a goddamn bear claw. He might as well have grown his claws the length of finger shears, burned his face, and called himself Freddy. But yeah, no thumbs meant a huge step backward on the evolutionary totem pole, putting him somewhere between orangutan and horse.

Thanks to his niece, Frieda, Karl worked at a taco stand where he sliced and diced onions, cilantro and meat with his bear claws. Afterwards he smelled like asada and pollo. Stray cats and dogs followed him with tongues flopping out, but other than that, he enjoyed his work.

His job was so down-to-earth-human cool. He liked to watch water drops spread across the glass jars of juice – strawberry, lemon, and horchata. The customers were fun to watch too. They sat on beige, steel convention chairs under the light of the moon and two blinding bright floodlights. Or they stood, conversing. They drank horchata to assuage the hot salsa that made mouths tingle and burn, forehead's sweat, eyes water and sting, noses run, and people come close to collapsing.

On breaks, Karl would attempt to talk art and sculpture with his customers. But he had no luck. Wrong demographic if he wanted to share an appreciation for the destructive beauty of sculpture and artistic disposition. Not even explaining that he sculpted with his feet impressed these late-night taco fiends, these nocturnal werewolves that craved the pollo. The way he worked a chisel with his toes and how his brow scrunched, creating tiny river valleys of sweat, was undeniably beautiful.

"You should join the circus," his customers would say. "Yeah, we'd pay to see you. Forget the bearded woman. We got the man with a horse hoof and bear claw for hands!"

What he did wasn't worth a slot in some circus freak show. These people's fascination with freaks was to alleviate their feelings of being the lowliest scum, that beneath them, was him. Karl could sympathize with that. He too had his ways of feeling mightier. How could he be scum if a woman had called him beautiful? Granted it was his niece, and there was no way to prove the validity of her statement. But still!

Karl and Frieda used to sleep naked in the same bed. They slept so close that Karl's hand sometimes cupped a handful of Frieda's ass or groped the curve of her hips, her soft warm skin.

"Accident. Accident," he used to mumble in half-sleep.

Frieda would say, "You're so sweet, Karl. You know I trust you. You are beautiful."

Karl would lie there with his heart fluttering, his mind replaying those words – You are beautiful.

Yesterday Frieda stopped calling Karl beautiful. They stopped sleeping in the same bed, too. Frieda had met someone two months ago. His name was Trevor Rex. He wore a latex lizard head everywhere he went and made Frieda laugh like a wildebeest or a garden variety hippopotamus. She'd laugh so hard her stomach would ache and her face would turn red. In the afternoon, Trevor had moved into the studio with his vat of tarantulas and collection of latex lizard heads.

"Sorry Karl, but you have to sleep here now," Frieda had said. She opened the closet door, empty except a broom, pillow and blanket. "Sorry. I couldn't find a spot for the broom. If you can find one. Feel free."

She did everything short of saying he wasn't wanted anymore.

"OK," Karl had mumbled with his head down. He wanted to smash Trevor's face in with his hoof.

"I know you're upset," Frieda had said. "But you knew this would happen one day. I'm turning 24 in three months. I have to grow up. That includes sleeping with my Uncle."

"Right. I understand. Don't mind me. Imagine I'm a plant." Karl scrunched into the closet. He reached for the pillow and blanket.

Frieda wrapped the blanket around him and placed the pillow behind his head. She kissed his forehead. Karl closed his eyes. "Trevor lost his job. I couldn't let him live in the streets."

"Can I ask you something?"

"Always. Never be afraid to say what's on your mind."

"If you weren't related to me and I was younger, do you think it would have worked out?"

"It's not going to happen, so why think about it? There are other fish in the sea."

"OK. I'll close the door. Good night." He shut the door.

Rather than sleep in the closet and listen to Frieda and Trevor make love, Karl began to spend his nights in a car repair yard and sculpt statues. He put his anger and frustration into sculpting. Night after night he chiseled away, destroying rock in hopes of creating something beautiful.

One night on the bus ride home Karl met Natasha. She had no deformities, but she was filthy and left off the stench of sweaty thighs and raw garbage. Her hair looked like exotic bush leaves. But magic happened when Karl gave Natasha a pollo taco. Had it been asada instead, things may not happen the way they would.

"You taco, are a gift from God." She covered her mouth as she devoured the taco. Her gums soaked up fatty pollo juices and grease.

If the bus driver saw her, he'd kick her fat ass off. He was of the breed of grizzled late-night veteran chauffeur of homeless degenerate scum that took shit from no one, especially those that made his bus reek. His main tactic was to turn the air-conditioner to frigid and freeze these fleabags off. Most were well insulated with their tattered assortment of coats and sweaters and beanies, so the cold disturbed them minimally. Only the ones who still held some shred of dignity took offense. It was more insulting to open a window and breath the fresh, cold air than to tell some homeless hag that she smelled rancid, that one more whiff of her putrid stench would make them puke their guts out. They could even die. Either way it hurt. Inside. In there. Point to the heart.

"Can you believe someone said that to me?" Natasha said.

Karl shook his head and held his breath. He came close to gagging. His eyes watered.

"Don't cry, Karl," Natasha said. "I am of the faith that things can be worse."

The next morning, Karl, with black circles around his blood shot eyes, saw the blurry image of Frieda drinking coffee in her bathrobe. Trevor slept on the futon, that grotesque lizard head's eye opened wide. The room was tints of grays and blues, hued by a sunless sky shooting through the balcony screen door. What light there was had to slip through the arms of trees, big maple leaves, and rooftops.

Karl stumbled over to Frieda. He placed a statue on the table. "This is for you."

Frieda traced her finger over the statue's strong legs, wide hips, mildly sagging breasts, and curly hair. "You're sweet, Karl. You amaze me sometimes. This is me isn't it?"

"I wanted to make something beautiful. You're what came to mind." Karl sat down. He sipped some coffee, making sure not to pierce Frieda's forearm with a wayward bear claw.

"Maybe you and Trevor could team up. He used to be in sales you know."

"I don't know, Frieda. I made this for you."

"But you can make others. As long as there's stone in this world, right?"

Karl reached for Frieda' hand, but she moved it away, hiding it under the table. "I once had a dream that we were married. We had two normal kids. And I had surgery to get real hands. And you had started your own vegan restaurant just as you've always told me."

"You should got to bed, Karl. I don't think these long nights out are good for you."

The next night Karl ran into Natasha again. She was sitting in the blue light of the 32 bus. Same spot as last night. Same lonely face. He sat next to her, placing his hoof and bear claw between his thighs. He slouched, as if his back and neck had turned into a snake. As usual the bus was freezing and the little bear and horse hairs on his forearms rose like puppet strings.

Karl and Natasha sat in silence as the bus rumbled to its predestined location.

"Can I touch your hoof?" Natasha looked between Karl's thighs, where his hands lay sandwiched. She touched his wrist with fingertips that felt like stale bread.

"Go ahead." Karl lifted his greasy hoof. He closed his eyes, because the sight of real human hands petting his deformities created an urge to smash faces in.

Karl felt no roving fingers, just still ones curled around his wrist. Then her hand glided to his hoof and began to pet.

This was different, the way she did it. He could feel it. No longer stale bread, but the warm fluff of fresh baguettes. She was caressing.

He opened his eyes and looked into sad gray ones surrounded by bloated skin. There were scars too, all over, the work of insects who used pincers and claws to burrow homes and lay eggs in her face. White stubble grew around her crackled lips and her hills of chins.

"I got this for you." Karl pulled a taco from his bag, unwrapping the foil that covered it.

Natasha smiled as she took the taco in her hands. She opened her mouth to savor that first bite of grease and pollo when the bus lurched to a stop. Metal screeched and the windows banged. No one had pulled the cord and the streets were empty, dark, lit faintly by the orange glow of street lights. Not a bus stop in sight either, just a gas station and a 24-hour breakfast place.

The bus driver, a man who always wore shorts that revealed his fat thighs, strutted up to Karl. Every few steps his shoulders hit the aluminum handrails. "There's no eating on the bus," he said. "Throw it away. Or take it outside."

"It's just a taco," Karl said.

"You can join her out there too, if you want. Just two less freaks I have to babysit."

"Come on. Let's go." Karl grabbed Natasha's greasy hand and they stepped into the night chill. The muscles in Karl's hoof tensed up. He should've smashed the driver's face in, just like he should've joined the boxing team as a teenager. Imagine the possibilities of anger released through a horse hoof.

The bus drove away.

"There's a car repair yard a few blocks back. We can stay there." Karl said.

"Maybe it would have been easier if I'd just thrown the taco away."

"He can't treat you like that."

"Better than standing in the cold."

"What happened to things could be worse?" Karl asked as they walked to the car repair yard.

Natasha walked by his side. Maybe she followed because she was afraid of being alone. Karl didn't know, but he was glad she came along.

"I can only lie to myself so much," Natasha said. "I think I was born to live this life. I came out a twenty pound baby with gray eyes and got left on the doorstep of a Latino family who dropped me off with the police at the sight of me. No one wanted me."

A metal fence with barbed wire surrounded the car repair yard that Karl sculpted in. Toyotas and Hondas with broken windshields, missing wheels, dented bodies, smashed headlights, and torn upholstery were scattered among engine parts and wrenches. Tire towers wobbled into the sky.

"I'd like to make a sculpture of you.” Karl took out a block of stone and a chisel. He placed them on piece of scrap metal lying on a stack of two tires. A coffee table book, propped up, hid the stone from Natasha.

"Sure. OK. Where do I stand?" Natasha looked to her left and right. Her arms covered her chest.

"Anywhere's OK. Can you also take off your clothes?"

"No, I don't think I can do that."

"I can make you beautiful." Karl pulled out his statue of Frieda.

"I changed my mind. I don't know why I came with you."

Karl shook his head. He was used to rejection and weird looks from strangers. Sometimes he imagined the armored carapace of an armadillo growing around him. With each insult the shell engulfed him further. "Soon I will be impregnable!" he'd once said. But every time he found himself still vulnerable, even more so now because he considered Natasha worse off than he. Remember, a woman had called him beautiful, even though she may or may not have meant it.

He lifted his horse hoof and crushed the statue of Frieda. Stones pieces scattered and flew into the night like a miniature meteor shower.

Natasha shook her head. "I don't know why I'm doing this."

She sat on a tire and began to pull off her shoes and socks. Her foot was bruised and calloused. Her toe nails were calcified and crooked like crows' claws. She slipped her arms free from her sweater and then rolled it up from her waist over her head. After pulling her sweatpants to her knees, she stopped. She shivered. "Can you turn around?"

Karl turned around. He closed his eyes and tensed all the muscles in his horse hoof.

Nothing would stop him from making her beautiful. She would see her beauty once he finished. But then it occurred to him that there was no denying her physical repulsiveness. He'd felt relieved when she asked him to turn around, and he'd closed his eyes because it helped block the image of her spider-veined thighs.

"OK, you can look." Natasha sat with her legs touching and hands cupped over her breasts. Her body was covered in continent-sized bruises and welts.

"You look like a model. I've never had a model before." Karl sat on a chair he'd removed from one of the cars, leaned back, lifted his foot and picked up the chisel.

"You know, if I weren't this disgusting blob of fat I could've married someone. Any guy would do. I wouldn't care if they abused me."

"It's not too late. I believe in change."

"When I was in high school, I thought this boy liked me. He wanted to take me to the lake. He said we were going to swim, and if I didn't know how, he would teach me. I was so happy, I bought a swimsuit with flowers on it. We drove out there with his older brother and a couple of his friends. The whole time he made me feel welcome, asking me questions about my life. What I liked to eat. Things of that nature. Once we got to the lake. It was a beautiful lake. The water was so clean and blue, it sparkled. The boy then handed me my bag, and said, 'why don't you change. There's some bushes over there. We won't look.' I smiled and practically skipped to the bushes, hoping they would. After I took off my pants, they drove off."

Karl chiseled away, flaking off stone with precision. One mistake could be fixed, but once he chiseled to the heart, there'd be nothing left to salvage. He knew that well, the countless pieces of disfigured statues he'd buried.

"How'd you get home?" Karl asked.

"By the time I walked to the highway my calves ached so bad I was limping. Sat there crying into my swimsuit for an hour, waiting for a car to pull over. And what I thought was how I hated everyone and one day I would be beautiful and rich and that boy, who I hated more than creepy hippy guidance counselors, would apologize for back then and ask me out on a date and I would ignore him. Thinking that made me so happy."

The statue of Natasha was coming into shape, the legs and arms, the body. Karl was working on the face. He chiseled tears on her cheeks and a frown. Though her eyes were bloodshot and jaundiced, the real Natasha wasn't crying. Karl chalked it up to artistic license, a touch that would reveal Natasha's beauty to everyone.

"Then evening rolled around. I'd torn my swimsuit to pieces and a million cars had passed me by and finally this blue car pulled up with the headlights shining in my face. I cried when they told me to get in. It was the boy and his father. The boy apologized. He handed me a box of tissues. He asked if I wanted to stop for a bite. He asked if I wanted to watch a movie sometime. And I said no to everything."

By the time Karl finished the statue, the sun had risen from behind the mountains. The grapefruit colored sky growing bluer. Birds chirped and cars passed the yard with increasing frequency. Store signs glowed in bright colors. The world was waking up.

Karl asked Natasha to come to his studio, and she agreed after putting on her clothes. He put the statue in his bag before Natasha could see. She never asked, seemed almost afraid of how it had turned out.

When they got to Frieda's place, no one was home.

Karl handed Natasha a towel. "Why don't you take a shower? You'll feel better."

"I'd like that. Where's the bathroom?"

Karl pointed to the door with a lizard head super-glued to it and a placard that said, "The Shit Station."

After Natasha disappeared into the bathroom, hopefully for a long shower, Karl sat on Frieda's bed, the one he used to sleep in so comfortably. When he reached inside his bag, he pulled out shattered legs, an ear, a chipped head, and two pieces of torso. He tried gluing the statue together, but it kept crumbling. He worked to the sound of water, a bathroom fan's whir, and the occasional footstep squeak on porcelain. He imagined Natasha vigorously scrubbing dirt and grime off her body.
