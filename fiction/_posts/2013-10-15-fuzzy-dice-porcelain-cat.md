After telling a co-worker to hitch a ride back to Vietnam, Rosco, who was in the midst of savoring a rye bread, pastrami and jalapeño sandwich, was confronted by his manager and forced to enroll in racial sensitivity training. It wasn’t just that he told this co-worker to return in the rickety boat that had smuggled him into the United States in the first place, but that he continued on by saying that he better rub his jade Buddha’s belly for luck because this time he would be hard-pressed to survive the starvation, torrential rain, sharks and Thai pirates ready to pillage and rape him.

Rosco found his punishment unjust because he had intended the comment to be a joke, maybe an insensitive one, but a joke nonetheless. After the manager left, Rosco picked up a jalapeño by the stem and watched it bob up and down. The coat of sulfate made the skin glisten under the lights. He thought it resembled a shriveled tongue and when he bit into it, memories of the Vietnam War rushed through his mind like the tang of sulfates drenching his mouth.

The very next Sunday, Jimmy Trong Lam, who had escaped from Vietnam on a small fishing boat and who had found himself in America after a year-long wait in a Malaysian refugee camp, introduced himself to Rosco as his racial sensitivity trainer. He suggested that they get to know each other over lunch at a restaurant in Little Saigon, a proposal that Rosco scoffed at by saying, “Look, Jimmy, this ain't some blind date. This is a fucking racial tolerance program. All I'm gonna do is sit through your bull so I can get back to work, same as ever.”

Inside the restaurant, an oscillating pedestal fan whirred in the corner. The flame retardant leaves of an artificial dracaena trembled. A few waitresses dressed in teal polo shirts darted around from customer to kitchen. Occasionally they exchanged smiles and a few words with each other. Music played softly from small speakers. Currently, an 80's style guitar solo saturated in reverb and too much chorus. When the solo faded out, the sensual voice of a female singer entered.

Rosco took a seat across from Jimmy. The mocha brown hair of his toupee looked almost natural if not for his black eyebrows. His horn-rimmed glasses threatened Rosco with a sense of intellectual superiority, and the silhouette of his polo shirt exposed a bulging belly that looked awkward on his otherwise slim frame. A beam of sunlight shone through the window, illuminating Jimmy's face.

“Rosco, my friend, have you ever had phở before?”

A simple 'yes' escaped Rosco’s lips. He held back the memories that surfaced, the humid days drinking Ba Muoi Lam, eating rice noodles drenched in thick pig fat, and telling embellished war stories.

“It is very good is it not? A lot of people, they say they don't like chicken liver with their phở, but I think it is tasty, especially with hoisin sauce and even a little Sriracha. But that is not really a Vietnamese condiment. It comes from the Thai actually,” Jimmy said.

A smiling waitress placed two teacups and a tin teapot on the table.

“It is amazing to me how in America all these people come together and create something like Chinese hotpot, Korean Bulgogi, or the Swiss Fondue.”

Jimmy wiped both cups with a napkin, filled one with tea, and proceeded to slosh the amber liquid back and forth between the two cups. Then he took two pairs of chopsticks and twirled them in his tea before drying them with another napkin. “When I was in Vietnam, you know, you go to a restaurant and you cannot be too sure if they cleaned the bowls and eating utensils. It saves water or if they did use water they may have reused it over and over again. But now there is no point here in America. They have safety rules to protect you now, but still there is a part of me that is stuck in the past ways of my life.” Jimmy placed a pair of chopsticks and a napkin in front of Rosco, who had raised the menu in front of his face. “Like you go into these restrooms here and they now have little signs reminding people to wash their hands, and it is in all languages: American, Mexican, Vietnamese, Chinese, and on and on. Some even have French. I remember seeing it once somewhere. Yes, at this French restaurant actually.”

A waitress walked in front of the table and pulled a notepad from her fanny pack. Rosco ordered the phở tái, pointing at the picture on the menu and reiterating that he wanted a large and not a small.

Jimmy asked about chicken livers, but the waitress rebuffed him, “No chicken liver here. No one like it.”

“Chicken livers are a staple and if you do not have them, then this is BS,” Jimmy said. “But okay, I’ll have the Bún Gà Nướng.”

After she left, he mumbled, “Serves me right for taking you to a chain. Mom and Pop is much better, but I was afraid it may not seem sanitary enough for you.”

Rosco reminisced about sleeping in the jungle and under the stars on nights where enormous rain drops splashed against his makeshift poncho tent. Wet dirt would cake his face and entangle in his hair as he lay shivering.

“Just to let you know, my name is not Jimmy Trong Lam, but Lam Trong Dung and you can probably guess why I changed it. When I came to America, my first job interview was at a casino in Las Vegas. I was applying to be a bus boy and took this opportunity very seriously. I wanted to answer his questions perfectly, but every time he said 'Dung', he would stop mid-sentence, breaking into this wild laughter and I did not know why until I checked the dictionary. I still remember the definition very clearly. The excrement of animals, manure, something foul or abhorrent,” Jimmy said.

“Dung, huh? You that insecure about yourself that you have to change your name? Where's your pride, man?”

“I am ashamed a bit about that. But I am in America now and I want to fit in with your society and being named 'Dung' makes me unwanted, disliked, the butt of jokes. And it does not help that I do not look like an American.”

“Look on the bright side Dung, at least you aren't named like this poor Vietnamese guy I met during my tour. His name was Dong Manh Nguyen. Dong Man we called him, and a few of us soldiers were gonna mess him up good for taking some of our C-rations and he told us his name and we ended up laughing our asses off and that sneaky bastard snuck off.”

“Yes, I am glad my name is not Dong. In Vietnamese it means winter and that seems a bit like a girl's name to me, but it is a boy's for a reason I do not know. And for one dollar you can get 15,916 Dongs, minus exchange fees.”

Rosco chuckled. “Good, glad you have a sense of humor about things. Some people, they take shit too seriously and they don't get that I'm just joking. That's how I get stuck doing some racial tolerance crap instead of spending my Sunday watching the Raiders and having a beer.”

The waitress carried a plastic tray. Her fingernails, shaped like bullets, long and silver, clasped onto the ends, holding it steady so the broth would not slosh out of the bowl. Rosco watched her. She was middle-aged with dark eyes, long lashes and graying hair that she pulled back and tied in a ball that revealed her ears.

She placed the food on the table and scurried back to the kitchen, Rosco following her with his eyes until she disappeared into the smoke and aroma of beef broth bubbling in pots and that familiar, yet unfamiliar language of hers. “You know, that waitress reminded me of this funny story that happened to me on my first mission.”

“Tell me about it,” Jimmy said as he poured fish sauce into his bowl. He used his chopsticks to mix the grilled chicken with the vermicelli noodles, lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumber.

The pungent odor infiltrated Rosco's nostrils as he told his story.
