The mother lay in bed with her eyes closed but not asleep. She was thinking about nothing at all. She just stared at the ceiling in the dark, at this spider gradually lowering itself with its invisible thread of web.

Meanwhile, the father and the oldest son were driving three hundred miles south of home on Interstate One. They were not on a road trip or pilgrimage of the father and son bonding type. They were on a rescue mission. The youngest son had called around midnight and informed the father that he was in San Luis Obsipo and that some conservative prick cop had locked him up. The reason was unspecified, but the message was clear -- Get him the fuck out of there.

During the drive the father both condemned and forgave the youngest. He mostly forgave though. If not for his arrest, the youngest would be sleeping at home tonight, once again protected by the parental nest egg. The father would be lying if he said he was not happy about the youngest's return from attempt number one at becoming independent and making it out there in the real world. The father had pegged the youngest son's odds for failure at ten to one with an over/under of a year and three months.

The father's Achilles' heel was his disregard for luck, or rather its existence. Put another way, the belief that destinies can be controlled through unrelenting optimism. Or put yet another way, the belief that the lotto is a game of who can best harvest winning numbers from their dreams.
At the start of the year, the father weighed 150 pounds and now nearing autumn, he weighed 135 pounds. The sight of him without his shirt was ghoulish, all sunken chested and outlines of rib bones and liver spots and deadish-gray skin. The problem got so bad that he took showers fully dressed.
The oldest said the father should sell his weight-loss secrets to women who squeezed and measured their belly fat at night.

The father did not laugh and went on a long monologue about how he had been so busy coming to the rescue of his family that he had not eaten much, that not even the constant growling and burning in his stomach could persuade him to stop for a moment and enjoy a good steak with a good beer.
The oldest said nothing. It was clear to him he should say something, but what this something was he did not know.

The father, maybe noticing this silence, told the oldest that everything would be alright. Come Christmas they would go skiing in Tahoe. Mom and Dad and little brother. Everyone together as one familial unit. They would stay in the Silver Legacy where he had connections, where he had primo discounts for rooms and buffets, and where they would stay until after New Years.
