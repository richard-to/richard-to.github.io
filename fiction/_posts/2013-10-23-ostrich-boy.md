The reason I hate Saul Ruckdeschel is because Nadine Frohling is his girlfriend and not mine. Saul says why are you in love with a retard? And I say, why are you? And he says who says I am? And I say I heard you out on the porch swing. And he says I feel bad for her.

The other day I asked my mom if she thought Nadine Frohling was beautiful. My mom turned away from the steak she was grilling and looked at me very seriously. She said I've seen the pictures in your room. And pointing to the charred-black steak, I said, the steak.

The day after the other day I asked again if she thought Nadine Frohling was beautiful. She was squeezing orange juice from oranges this time. It took ten of them sucked dry to make one cup. Her arm went into this intense wrenching motion when she ground the oranges on the citrus reamer. Not only that but her face looked angry. Her teeth were clenched and sweat dripped down her forehead.

Before I asked about Nadine, I asked why don't you buy OJ from the store. My mom lifted her hand away from the orange she was squeezing and her face relaxed. She said I enjoy making orange juice.

Not knowing what to say I said good for you, like how my dad always says. Good for you son. Good for you.

And I asked about Nadine again. And she said she's a sweet girl, but she's a little slow. Besides there's much prettier girls in town. How about Corinne Sacks? she said. And I said I know, I know, Nadine's a retard. And mom said, Nadine's just slow. Some people are late bloomers. Remember the ugly duckling?

Nadine has the eyes of fish and the distance between her thumb toe and second toe is wider than anyone's. Plus her head is so small and shaped funny, like a trapezoid. I think maybe God was pissed off by all the Americans dying in Iraq, so before he sculpted Nadine's skull, he probably got shitfaced, like my big brother always says. Man, I was so shitfaced last night. No, no, my friend, I was ten times more shitfaced than you. Ask Jensen. Ask Flannigan. Those are his friends in Iraq. He tells me on webcam.

Being Nadine Frohling's girlfriend is not about love. It's about money. Mrs. Frohling is paying Saul to be Nadine's boyfriend. Eventually they may get married. But only when Mrs. Frohling says so. Gives the A-OK.

Mrs. Frohling is controlling everything. That's why Saul says Nadine's trapezoid face is beautiful. That's why he sits on the porch with her night after night, whispering words that make her smile and giggle.

I asked Saul does he miss doing all the things us boys are doing? And he said time is money. And I said you sound like my dad. My dad who flies around the world collecting millions of frequent flyer miles and who has eaten steak in thirty countries. My dad who is too busy being a professional schmoozer to spend an evening at home and try my mom's.

And Saul said when I turn 16 I'm going to buy a Porsche and ask out Nicolette. And I said Nicolette Dresden? And he grinned and said that Nicolette. Nicolette who is the prettiest girl in the whole sixth grade. Nicolette who wears a bra of size C already! Like my mom once said while discussing with another mom about Nicolette's boobs, my goodness, I wasn't a C-cup until I was pregnant with my first son. And all I could say was do you want to see the scab I got while riding my bike on the dirt hills?

No one makes fun of Saul. All the parents in the world think he is the most wonderful young man in the world for befriending a retard. What a good egg he is! they like to say. The girls are kind of repulsed, but they only talk amongst themselves, critiquing Nadine's use of 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner Pert Plus, rather than Herbal Essences. The boys don't make fun of him because he had the business know how to propose this deal with Mrs. Frohling and they didn't. How could they compete for the heart of Nicolette Dresden without a Porsche?

The answer is so simple, but no one dares tells the truth because Nadine is so happy to be with a boy, even though Saul is 12 and she is 17. Mrs. Frohling says that anyone who threatens to tell the truth will be ostracized by the community.

In recent years Pinewood's motto has been embrace all, live in harmony. The Scheper's who live down the street even took in a Korean foreign exchange student, which was followed by the Thackston's bid for an Iraqi one, and the Vanepp's hosting a whole Afghan family for two months in the summer. In Pinewood Koreans, Iraqis, Afghans, and retards are the same as us, we say.

I think I'm going to tell Nadine the truth. I no longer care about being ostracized. So what if I turn into an ostrich? Maybe one day when Nadine is much older and has learned to use Herbal Essences to make her hair smell girly, she will come to the zoo with a husband who loves her, and she will pass by the ostrich cage and thank me.

I told this idea to my brother on webcam. He said good for you. Just like my dad always says. And I said I know this is all a pipe dream you don't have to lie. He laughed and said you don't know what a pipe dream is. And then I got curious on what happens to retards when they grow up. And he said the last time he saw a retard was in high school. He never saw one in college or here in Iraq. But he didn't say retard. He said developmentally delayed person. He said don't call them retards, dipshit. And I said you're a dipshit. And he said, Ostrich Boy, stop counting the fucking days will you, I'm coming home soon.
