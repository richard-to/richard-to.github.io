excerpt: "Thad flew in from Los Angeles the day before the wedding"
---


1

Thad flew in from Los Angeles the day before the wedding. He hugged his mom and dad when they greeted him on the porch with big smiles. When it came time to hug his brother Les, they shook hands. Les had held his hand out. Thad had his arms open. Like bird wings.

2

Thad chugged orange juice from the carton while his parents watched with big smiles. His mom bought Tropicana because the American Heart Association approved. She only bought food that mentioned one or more of the following: Low Fat, Low Sodium, No Carbs, Vitamin Fortified, Sugar Free or Organic. The groom was one those people who bought Tropicana orange juice, so instead of hiring a professional wedding videographer, he'd asked Thad to film the ceremony and banquet. No one could screw up a wedding video, not even the perpetually stoned Thad.

3

Disappointment crossed his parents' faces when they asked to see the movies Thad had made. He told them he'd left the DVDs in L.A. They could see the movies the next time he drove up to the Bay. Everyone in class, he added, thought his films were the best. That made his parents smile big again and forget that the only letters from L.A. they received were parking tickets.

When I'm a famous director, Thad said, I'll buy a mansion in Texas. For you Mom. For you Dad. So you can relax and not worry again. So you can enjoy life. I love you Mom. I love you Dad.

And this made his parents smile even bigger. By the end of the night their lips were going to droop and jiggle like belly flab after liposuction.

Les knew the truth, but because he believed in the honor of promises, he kept quiet, remained hunched by the glass table and repeated in his mind a thousand times: Amitabha. Amitabha. Amitabha.

During his time at the Los Angeles Film School, Thad had spent much of his time high, experimenting with acid, psilocybin mushrooms, ecstasy, cough medicine, marijuana, cocaine, salvia, Vicodin, OxyContin and heroin. None of this bothered Les, because he believed people could do what they wanted, but what angered him was that his brother had no qualms about leeching from his parents.

The only movie Thad had made at film school was an untitled horror flick shot in the house of the groom's best friend, who was Filipino, wrote for Revolver and loved adobo. Les was reminded of his old writing when Thad played the movie. The typical recourse for no-talent nineteen-year-olds who grew up on Tarantino films was to overuse the f-word and comic violence. Fuck was both funny and hip. Fuck was also meaningless.

Although Les was no longer nineteen and understood when to use fuck, he enjoyed the ending, even let loose a big hearty laugh, because a part of him still rejoiced in the nihilism of his generation, though afterward he spent eight hours meditating, which for him meant sleeping, deeply.

After fighting with his wife during breakfast, the husband, who worked at an adult film and toy store, bought her a big black rubber dildo. Here, Thad interjected that that was no rental. He'd kept the receipt, but the thing had broke after the shooting. White powder had poured from the lacerated center, leaving the dildo limp in spots. When the husband opened the door, he said, Honey, I'm home. I got a present for you. There was no response, and making his way to the bedroom, he shouted, Where are you, you ungrateful bitch? Then a flash cut to the zombified face of his wife. The husband backpedaled as she lunged at him. Blood dripped from her eyes and mouth. There was no fear on the husband's face, just a blank expression. When they reached the living room, he looked at the dildo, back at his wife, then back at the dildo. Grinning he pulled the price tag off and started hitting her with the dildo, his arm windmill whirling until she crumpled to the ground.

What'd you think? Thad said. Am I great or am I great?

The mother of the brothers Les and Thad wanted them to spend more time together, so she enlisted Les as the assistant to Thad. Les agreed to operate the secondary camera on the condition that he could attend in street clothes. Playing accomplice to Thad was a tough concession. Although their days of direct competition had ended years ago, Les could never let his brother win. In fifth grade Thad had complained that Les only won at basketball because he was taller and older, and why did he not ease up? Play easy? The last game they played, years ago, a fall evening, dark like clouds of octopus ink sprayed in their eyes, Les won 21 â€“ 4. Thad had given up or lost confidence, and for every clank off the rim, Les swished a three pointer.

After the final bucket, Thad slung the ball at his brother's face. A whiff. The ball slammed against the fence.

Les said nothing, just shrugged. His lack of response was worse than if he'd called his brother a pussy.

Thad charged with his head down, but Les caught him in a headlock, squeezed his neck so hard his face flushed purple so it looked close to explosion, a burst of blood splattering, and his voice became the sound of Hollywood ghouls.

Thad threw elbows. He pinched and tore at his brother's forearm. He tried bulldozing him into the fence. Nothing worked, so he gave up.

5

I wish my name was Paul, Thad said. Then together, with our powers combined, we could be Les Paul! We should do that at the wedding. I'll be Paul. You be Les. Think you can do that, brother?

6

The morning of the wedding, with the exception of Les and Thad, everyone who looked at the sky thought the ceremony was ruined. How could it rain today, and on such good people? Maybe if they jointly prayed, the sky would control its jealousy and wish for the happiness of the platinum-selling hard rock vocalist and the daughter of a millionaire door knob maker.

The parents of Les and Thad told them to pray. We must do this together, the mother snapped. She expected many weddings to come in the next decade, as the sons and daughters of her seven brothers and sisters grew and fell in love. She wished them all well, because she wanted the same for her sons. The father stood in the center, holding the family-sized umbrella like a Samurai sword as it swiveled to the wind's whispers. Rain pellet-gun-thwacked the pongee.

How long have they been together? Les asked.

Ten years, which is why we have to pray for them, the mother said with her eyes closed.

While Les said, I don't want to pray, Thad said, If we all think positive, we can change the world!

On the drive to the bride's house, Les told Thad a story, because that was what he did. I used to know this girl named Delphia, he said, who dated the lead guitarist for We are the Audubon for a year. She was in love with him. She loved smalltime musicians with no spine and who smoked the weed. One day they went to the beach. They watched the waves wash sand from their feet. They were waiting for the sunset, because this girl she really loved sunsets and beaches. All that was missing was his secret weapon, his beloved Basilia, a Martin D-42 Peter Frampton Signature Edition. The guy knew this, but he was suave, so the moment the sun was half hidden in the horizon and turning the sky all these brilliant oranges and reds and purples, he drew a heart in the sand with her foot. She had beautiful feet too, and he made sure to compliment and kiss them.

This heart, he said, symbolizes our undying love and attraction for each other. People like us, we don't need marriage.

She swooned and leaned her head against his shoulder. I love you, she said. I love you, he said.

In the end they broke up. The lead guitarist for We are the Audubon married the girl's best friend. As a consolation prize they gave Delphia a fish tank and asked her to say good things about them at the wedding. Don't be shy, the bride had said, tugging on the sleeve of Delphia's blue zippered hoodie. You're a poet, so I know what you have to say will be elegant. The bride continued to push her and said, Everyone, don't you want to hear Delphia say a few good words? A chorus of approval followed. Some stamped their feet. Others hollered.

And right then, Delphia, red-faced and with hands clenched, said, You want elegant? You want elegant? You're having a wedding in a middle school gymnasium that smells like rancid B.O. and sneakers. None of the tables or chairs match, and you're serving Pabst Blue Ribbon. And you want elegant? Fuck you.

What would've made the afternoon perfect was if they'd fought, too. Delphia would've won in a knockout. She was 5'11" and big boned, while her best friend was 5'5", chubby, and hindered by garters, high heels and a rental bridal gown.

For two months Delphia drank SoCo and wrote poetry about the lead guitarist for We are the Audubon. One day she became alarmed by how many of her poems expressed hope that he still loved her, so she began writing bitter ones. And her poetry improved.

So what's the point? Thad said. You liked her?

Thad's vintage VW Beetle, with its treadless tires and lack of windshield wipers, was a sunshine car, perfect for Southern California, Nevada and Arizona, so when the rain began to fall in torrents, Les said, Stop the car.

Calm down, brother, Thad said. He hammered the throttle. The Beetle's Porsche engine responded with a speed burst. Water rose in waves to either side, fanned up by tires spinning furiously.

I feel blind, Les said, looking out the passenger-side window. Everything was blurry, washed with rain drops.

You're not blind. The rain is opening your eyes, Thad said. Take a good look at the real world.

I don't see anything. Stop the fucking car. Les enjoyed life from a distance. There was no value in intrusion, except when done from afar. Observing the world from a car gave the impression of temporality, which was almost as good as being a wall flower. Or invisible. But with the windows obfuscated from rain, he was forced to look inward at the car cabin.

What do you see, brother?

Les closed his eyes as a last ditch attempt to disappear.

10

Two months ago Les was driving to L.A. to see Delphia. This was an unwanted visit. Strange how three weeks ago he was welcomed. When things were good between them, she once said, I wish I had a teleportation machine. Now it was more like no response at all, which was the worst possible thing.

Much to the relief of Delphia, Les never made it. He dozed off to Radiohead's Airbag and then clobbered a federal guardrail on I-5, though in actuality it was the other way around. Damage to the truck's engine was severe enough to label it scrap metal. Only the rear wheels and truck bed were salvageable, usable as spare parts for some piece of shit Frankenstein machine. Thank Buddha his foot had slid off the throttle.

On impact the airbag exploded into Les' face, opened his eyes to the quote-unquote whiteness. The smell of burning plastic awakened some of his senses, but Les was still blinded. He could feel the truck, with its blown-out tire, whiplashing toward traffic like a gimpy bear. A honking car sped past just as his truck lumbered back into the guardrail, further gnarling federal steel.

The whiteness disappeared and Les found himself seeing the world through the cracked vision of a broken windshield. The truck could explode was his first thought. It came about with such calm; he might as well have told himself the sky was blue, the sun was yellow. Twisting and tugging the key only made his fingers calloused and red, so he scooped up his wallet, grabbed his guitar by the neck and stepped out the truck.

A dirt hill and noon sun greeted Les when he hopped over the guardrail. He sat in a patch of withered grass. The blades were so dry, they disintegrated in his fingers like the butterfly wings he once found in an old, old book about corn economics. Les spent a few seconds thinking about the age of the butterfly. Was it older than him? The crash had banged his guitar out of tune, so when he struck a chord, all he heard was dissonance. Peg by peg he tried to tighten and loosen the strings into harmony, but found himself incapable. Days later, when he tried to explain how he felt, his words let him down.

11

After the VW Beetle hydroplaned into a guardrail, Les said, Let's get out. The car may explode. And Thad said, OK.

Both got out and slammed the doors. They did so in unison. Rain fell hard and fast. Like pebbles from the sky. The brothers were drenched, their shirts clinging to their bodies, their hair matted flat and slick.

Les perched on a damp wood stump supporting the guardrail. He swayed back and forth, his calf matteduscles straining to keep balance. His ears hurt from the cold. I want to be like a pigeon, he said, and made the sound they made.

Shut up, Thad said. He inspected the damage. Broken headlight. Cracked windshield. Crumpled hood. Fucking. She's a goner. Fuck.

You call mom, Les said.

You call mom, Thad said. He threw the cellphone.

Les watched as it fell in the dirt. Clumps of grime and water droplets sullied the phone's metallic shell.

Are you retarded? Thad said.

Yeah, I'm retarded. Les hopped off his perch and walked toward his brother. He puffed up his chest and clenched his wet hands into fists.

You wanted me to crash, Thad said.

Les swung a haymaker at his brother's face. The punch was weak, he knew on impact. His worst fear come to fruition. He was no bigger than the last time they'd fought. Maybe he'd even shrunk, his back growing more hunched each year. Veganism had emaciated him, too, though he was proud of this. Ever since the crash, he wanted to be the ascetic Buddha.

12

Les and Thad considered themselves men, and they knew men didn't ask their fathers to rescue them. If anything it should be the other way around. But Thad had sucked up the inherent shame and told their father about the car crash. Thad sounded like he'd died. When the call was finished he threw the phone into the freeway.

Les stood on the wood stump. He faced the freeway with his feet pressed together in diving stance. He looked ready for the plunge. A deep breath. Two deep breaths. With the force of pistons he punched both fists in the air, just something to channel the hibernating energy of his voice.

We are Les Paul! he shouted. We are Les Paul!

Hey Les, do that again, Thad said. He pointed the camera in his brother's direction. I think you're finally seeing the real world.

All emotion flushed from Les' face as he turned toward his brother. His lips recoiled to a straight line. And his eyes, they returned to their blank, empty stare.

We are Les Paul! Thad shouted. Say it. We are Les Paul!

13

I'm a fuck up, Thad said.

Me too, Les said.

14

While they waited for their father to arrive, Thad recalled a childhood memory. They were both standing on wood stumps facing the freeway. The distance, the separation, between them was a few meters of federal guardrail. Thad had to shout to be heard.

Remember when we were younger, he said, before we grew apart, we used to play with stuffed animals. We didn't know it, but we were artists then. We are artists now. It seemed like play, but we were channeling our creative powers. We had a good bond then.

Look, Les said, we were never close. The only way we could communicate was through inanimate objects.

So what? Thad said. As if capturing rain drops from the sky, he reached up and pulled a stone from nowhere. Magic. He tossed it across the sinuate border of the guardrail.

The stone felt cold and wet when clapped between Les' palms.

Talk through the stone, Thad said.

Les said nothing. His eardrums, frozen from the rain, felt like bursting. The pain throbbed to his heartbeat, sharp stings surging at odd intervals. In the process of covering his ears, he dropped the stone.

You must think I'm selfish, Thad said. The drugs. Using mom and dad's money.

Les said nothing.

I'm thinking of moving back in, Thad said. Life is hard. Ever try cleaning a toilet?

When Les refused to respond, Thad said, I slept on the ground for three months. That's torture. I couldn't sleep, so I was this walking zombie most of time. It was hard to do well in film school because I was depressed. I had nothing.

Thad said, Listen to this Buddhist koan. Maybe this will help you understand where I'm coming from. It goes like this. An enthusiastic student asks his teacher: Master, what can I do to help all the suffering beings in this world? The teacher answers: Indeed, what can you do?

15

Les and Thad arrived two minutes before the wedding started. The ceremony was supposed to be held outside, but the rain had forced the bride and groom to improvise. The bride's parents were using blow dryers on the last of the plastic chairs salvaged from the backyard. Garland's of drowned plumeria were thrust in garbage cans.

It was funny how things worked out. The world was both fair and unfair in its randomness. But at the moment Les could only see the injustice. He almost expected an I told you so from Thad.

Instead of filming the ceremony, Les slipped outside and headed for the Koi pond. No one noticed. He was good at being invisible.

The rain's hard beating slowed to sprinkles. A girl who could be no older than seven pulled her white dress a little above her ankles and frolicked up the stone path. She stopped by the Koi pond, tiptoeing to catch a glimpse of the six to seven fish, who lived in such a crowded space that where ever they swam, they'd be face-to-face with another Koi.

Les said hi. He was sure he'd seen her before. But he wasn't sure which of his cousins she was. They all looked the same to him. Acted the same too, always frolicking and laughing about things little girls laugh about.

The girl turned to him and smiled. Her upper teeth were perfectly aligned and made of metal.

Les threw a plumeria petal into the air. It seesawed and swirled through the grating.

Hey, fish don't eat leaves, the girl said.

Oh, they don't? Les said.

Nope. They eat these small red candies. They're tiny little things, like about this size. She held her thumb and index finger together.

Les wondered if Koi had a three-second memory. But he couldn't fathom such big fish with goldfish brains, even if they were both types of carp.

Why aren't you inside? There's a wedding going on, the girl said.

I don't like people.

So you don't like me? She smiled as if she wasn't aware her metal teeth made her look like she'd chewed too much tobacco.

No, I like you. I just don't like certain people.

Like who?

Like people with a lot of money. Like people who are old. And by that I mean anyone over ten.

So in three more years, you'll hate me?

Who knows maybe you'll be different.

Do you mean like Peter Pan?

You're a very curious person. May I ask you a question now? Les started walking down the stone path, looking back every couple of steps.

But you haven't answered my question yet. The girl waved her arm and when Les had reached the bottom and not answered her, she hurried down, once again holding her dress slightly above the ankles.

Exactly like Peter Pan, Les said.

That's what I was afraid of. I hope you don't hate me when I'm ten.

Is it my turn to ask a question yet?

Yes. Go ahead.

From the looks of you, you don't seem like a people hating person, so what's the reason for you being out here, instead of in there? Les ducked down to her height and looked her in the eyes. He rarely looked at people when he spoke, and this made others think he was talking to himself or plain didn't care what they thought. And they were right, he didn't care all that much.

Butterflies in my stomach. The girl pressed her hands against her stomach and pretended to look sick.

Why's that?

I'm flower girl. I was so excited when I heard that I'd get to throw flowers and I said, I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. Yippee! I'm flower girl! I was jumping up and down telling my brother and my mom and my dad and my neighbor. But there's so many people out there. I can't do it.

What do you got to lose, you're only seven. You're not supposed to be scared of anything. The world is new.

That's easy for you to say. You're not flower girl.

Well, then, Flower Girl, I'm heading inside, and I'll be watching and seeing how disappointed everyone will be that Flower Girl's not tossing flowers from her little basket. And I'm sure the bride and groom will be even more disappointed. Maybe even angry that you ruined their wedding. The whole flow of it. The role of flower girl is a very important role. Think about what would happen if there was no Flower Girl.

Nope. I'm not doing it. Flower Girl hugged herself and shivered.

Les walked inside and headed to the living room. Everyone was crowded together. Everyone held cameras of various quality, from professional to camera phones. All faces pointed upward to the second floor balcony. A man and woman were reading an excerpt from Alice and Wonderland. Violin music played through a loudspeaker.

Since Les was standing in the hallway and couldn't see the bride and groom, he watched the faces of people he knew and didn't know. He filmed them. Flower Girl was not around, and it was already too late for her to run down the stairs throwing flowers. He kind of hoped she'd surprise him and do just that, but nothing of the sort occurred.

He filmed the expressions on everyone's faces, watched to see what this moment meant to them. A big bald guy laughed at how many children were running around. He appeared almost embarrassed. Whether for himself or the bride and groom wasn't clear. A group of grandmothers were playing card games in the kitchen. A newly married couple kissed in the hallway and discussed tomorrow's plans. When it was the bride and groom's turn to kiss, the people with camera faces flashed like psychotic clowns.

Les got it all. The footage was excellent, but he was looking for something else. He knew all along he wouldn't find it here, so he shut off the camera, ripped the lens from his eye, and repeated in his mind another thousand times:

Amitabha. Amitabha. Amitabha.
