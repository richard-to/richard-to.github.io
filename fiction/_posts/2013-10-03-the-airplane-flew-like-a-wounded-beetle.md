title: "The airplane flew like a wounded beetle"
---

I’m afraid of airplanes, but board them out of obligation.

It’s easy to buy plane tickets these days. It’s anonymous. It’s distant. It’s free of fear! You can’t put a face to the names and numbers. Not that it matters who I am beyond those things. It doesn’t care unless my name’s Muhammad. Even then it only cares enough to see me die a painful death.

I’m thinking of changing my name to Muhammad.

The corporate spyware that gets downloaded with my plane tickets doesn’t care either, unless I write my stories in password boxes with no character limit. Two forward slashes (//) signal a new paragraph. Ignore the numbers between letters. They mean nothing. It’s only there to keep them reading. But don’t ignore the numbers parsed between pound symbols (#). They mean something.

And now the dilemma. Ownership of one, sometimes two, plane tickets puts me in a precarious situation. Giving away a thousand dollars is not an option when the money’s not mine, when I don’t understand the freedom given up. This is what I mean by obligation.

My freedom’s limited without money.

I want to see a girl in Venezuela.

I'm also afraid of beetles, especially wounded ones.

Being afraid doesn’t mean caring. But caring can mean being afraid. 
Some people feel this way about dogs and cats. I feel this way about beetles.

When I was younger I killed beetles for fun. I crushed them with friends. We had beetle stomping contests. We crushed them with our feet. I could never do it with my bare feet and always had to wear shoes, or socks at the very least. The idea of earwax colored guts and assorted bug parts like antennae and mandibles smeared on my skin made me afraid. Back then I didn’t know this. I didn’t understand beetles the way I do now.

I am the beetle. The beetle is me. I am not the beetle. The beetle is not me.

That makes no sense. I want to be me all the time.

That’s why I can’t see the girl in Venezuela.
