Francis stared at his typewriter, afraid to press the keys and to hear the loud clicking and clacking of the typebars. No thoughts, ideas, or opinions came to mind; nothing angered or saddened him enough to cobble together a few pages or even a few paragraphs. A sentence would do at this point, but he’d rather watch short videos on the Internet and laugh at people saying and doing dumb things. When did this happen? Was the deterioration of his mind so gradual?

Francis’ brother Stanley opened the door slightly and poked his head into Francis’ room. Stanley was a shadow. The only light came through cracks in the blinds and the door. He crept inside, revealing his bloodshot eyes before turning his back and shutting the door quietly. They were shadows again. Francis placed his fingers on the keys and wanted to type “When will this stop?”

“I’m feeling sick again,” Stanley said. “Do you mind giving me a boost? I hate to ask when you’re mourning and all. I’m sad too, but you know how it is.”

Francis took a deep breath and shook his head. He closed his eyes when Stanley injected the syringe into the back of Francis’ skull, sending a prolonged shock through his spine that made him jump in his seat and bite his tongue. Francis swallowed blood, tasted copper.

“Thanks. You’re the best, brother.” Stanley pulled the syringe out, now filled with 50ml of brain tissue. He left the room and went to shoot up on their parents’ bed and lay lifeless for a day. Francis didn’t need to see, because that was the routine, which started with the stereo blaring Stanley’s latest dubstep mix. When the music played, the whole house vibrated; the sound crawled through the walls and the floorboards up through Francis’ feet like an electric current. A drumming droned through his ears and he cursed Stanley for his inability to write his parents’ eulogy.


Francis watched the crane lower his parents into their graves at the Gates of Heaven Cemetery on a humid afternoon that left him sweating and wishing that he had an extra dress shirt. His was drenched at the armpits and back, so he kept his blazer on. He wanted to show respect for his parents but also for his relatives who came to sit in uncomfortable metal chairs and sweat profusely under the sun too. Some people dabbed handkerchiefs on their foreheads and under their eyes, and everyone held water bottles or left them in the grass as they listened to a monk read monotonously. He never looked up from his book and licked his fingers before turning each page. Francis heard the words “oldest son” and wondered what the monk was saying? Did he blame Francis?

Stanley didn’t attend the funeral because of a message Uncle JC had left. “I am going to tell police about you. I know what juicing is. I am not dumb. I know why my brother is dead.” That was the gist of what he had said, but it was an empty threat. Stanley had only juiced his family and Francis had promised not to testify. But the morning of the funeral, Stanley, still recovering from his latest trip, decided not to risk it. “I’m not going,” he said. “Get the out of my room. The light hurts my eyes.”

The party after Francis’ parents’ burial perplexed him. He saw no need to celebrate, but stayed anyway, lingering in the shade of a big oak tree. He drank a cup of punch and watched JC burn fake money in a rusty tin can full of dents. The flames grew and grew.

Aunt Mai tapped Francis on the shoulder. He turned around, surprised that anyone noticed him. She used to give him baths when he was a baby and she never failed to mention this fact. But today was a serious day.

“Why didn’t you give a eulogy?” she asked. “Everyone was expecting one. You know everyone was thinking that you were defending your brother.”

Francis shrugged.

“You’re starting to go bald like your parents.” She looked like she wanted to touch Francis’ hair, but she let her arm drop to her hip and wiped her hand on her dress.

He nodded.

“How can you let him do this to you? Let me tell you a short thing about me,” Mai said. “When I was young I left my parents in Vietnam. I was very afraid to die. And more afraid to disobey my father. But I packed my things and snuck out on small boat. Smelled so bad, like a toilet.”

Francis took out a pack of sticky notes and wrote, “Because he will die.” Why didn’t he tell her the truth, that he hated his brother and actually had a recurring dream where he kidnapped Stanley in his sleep, covered his head with a burlap potato sack, drove him out to the desert, and pointed a gun to the back of his head. In the dream, Francis could talk and he said “Give me one reason why I shouldn’t kill you.” And at this point, he always woke up.

Mai grabbed Francis’ arms, digging her nails into his skin. She shook him hard, so his head thrashed back and forth. “Then let him fall. What is so hard about it?” She let him go and apologized for spilling his drink. The punch had drenched his shirt and left a pink stain.

They turned to the road when a car pulled up. Francis had expected to see the groundskeepers running with fire extinguishers or the manager coming to shut down JC’s satanic ritual. “You can’t do such a thing at the Gates of Heaven!” Francis imagined the manager saying. But the car belonged to his mom. The sunroof opened and two hands reached out, one holding a bullhorn. His brother stood up and said “Everyone. Listen.” He waited until his relatives turned to him. “My mom and dad, I love them. No one would want this for anyone unless they’re really fucking evil.” He surveyed the crowd. “I made a mistake that I regret every moment of my life. And you know what, it feels like fucking hell. But I know every one of you assholes don’t believe me. Except my brother. He understands what this is all about.” He paused and looked around again, and when Francis realized his brother was looking for him, he hid behind a tree, afraid of what lunacy Stanley had in store. Would he ask Francis to stand on top of the car so they could shout something obscene together? Or worse, would he ask Francis to say something good about him? Stanley stopped searching and resumed his speech, his eulogy. “Family. Today I want to tell you what that means. Family is about sacrifice and a belief that we’re all capable of good no matter how many times we fuck things up. Thank you.”

Stanley asked his brother to drive him home. He had lost his driver’s license months ago and had taken the car out of desperation. “I thought if I didn’t show up, it’d prove all those assholes right. And sitting in that house, I was getting paranoid. Alone with my thoughts. That was the worst thing.”

Francis hesitated. He was worried about leaving his car in the cemetery, sure that that the manager, after the freak circus he’d witnessed today would love to tow his car. Finally, Francis nodded and motioned for the keys. He slammed the door shut, started the car, and stomped on the accelerator.

Their neighborhood was quiet at night and lit by streetlights. Garbage cans and recycling bins lined the streets waiting for the garbage trucks to come. They passed yards with fountains, big palm trees, flowers, green grass, stone walkways. Through living room windows, televisions flashed images that imitated life.

“What do you think goes on in those houses?” Stanley stared out the window.

“Do you ever think about how we know nothing about our neighbors?”

At a stop sign, Francis reached into his pocket and dug up his sticky notes. He wanted to say that he never wanted a syringe stabbed into the back of his head again, but he wrote, “We should buy juice from now on. Your friends know any dealers?”

“We can’t afford it,” Stanley said. “Do you know how much a point of juice costs? You don’t make enough in a month. I tell you, it’s the fucking greedy ass cops jacking up the price, wanting to bust every juicer, dealer because they get a damn bonus per head. And if you get caught, ten years for a quarter minimum. Thirty for an eight-ball. The incentive’s there to fuck us over and then some.”

“Then we’ll juice some bums,” Francis wrote.

“I know you’re a goddamn mute, but are you fucking retarded, too?” Stanley sounded surprised, serious for once.

Francis drove passed his parents’ house and headed for the Sawyer Creek Trail. He heard that bums slept along the creek and he believed that the rumor was valid; he often found beer cans, whiskey bottles, and shopping carts on the trail, hidden in the brush and wooded areas.

“We have a good thing going. Let’s not fuck things up,” Stanley said. “I bet in a few years there’ll be some medicine I can take.”

Francis kept driving until he arrived at his old elementary school. A bike path next to the kindergarten classrooms led to the trail. He had made this discovery in fifth grade while hiding from a boy named Time who got this strange idea that beating up Francis would make him talk. “I saw it on the TV once,” Time had said.

“I remember this place. Brings back a lot bad memories,” Stanley said. “Mom got so mad when she saw my report cards. Why couldn’t she have told me that it was okay and that next time I would do better?”

“Wall of Fame.” Francis wrote.

“Yeah I remember. ‘Time Dinosaur.’ We rocked back then.” Stanley flashed a smile. There was no hint of the sarcasm and mockery that usually infected his smiles. “I wonder if the wall’s still up?”

The Wall of Fame was displayed along the first and second grade classrooms with the idea that the work of previous students would inspire the next generation to “reach for the stars” as Principal Kruger had said during the Wall’s inauguration. A large amount of work was chosen that first year, including a story written by Francis and illustrated by Stanley.

They walked to the Wall of Fame and found their story “Time Dinosaur” still on display, though the work of other students covered all four pages except the drawing of a stick figure fighting a Tyrannosaurus rex and the first line, “Stancis the Great traveled back to the time of the dinosaurs.”

“I wish I could travel back in time,” Stanley said.

Francis was about to write, “Me too,” but then he got an idea and wrote, “He came to stop the meteor.” He stuck the note under his original sentence.

“Then a T. rex attacked him and Stancis said, ‘Stupid, I came to save you’,” Stanley paused as Francis wrote the line down. “The T. rex tried to bite Stancis’ head off, so Stancis slayed the T-Rex with his sword.”

Francis added three more notes, including one that said, “The T. rex was made of metal and wires.”

“That’s not what happened.” Stanley crumpled the note. “The next line goes: Next a Triceratops came out of the jungle and roared.”

“Professor F.R. Ley. stood on top of the Triceratops and said, ‘Ha! Ha! Ha! You fool! There was no meteor!’” Francis put the note on the glass and began scribbling another. “An epic battle ensued that lasted seven nights and ended with Stancis stabbing Professor F.R. Ley in the stomach.”

“That’s retarded,” Stanley said. “We both know the ending is: Stancis the Great stopped the meteor with his bare hand.”
