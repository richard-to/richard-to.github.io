title: "The emptiness of a sunset"
---

Around three in the afternoon, the north food court in SFO's International Terminal was deserted except for Donny Foster and a family of four, all of whom were scattered around and pursuing their own activities. The father was ordering fried rice from Fung Lum Express while mentally undressing the petite cashier whose ponytail was threaded through the back of her cap. His two sons were climbing the guardrails that ran the circumference of the dining area, which was designated by shiny black tiles, a clear contrast from the white ones which surrounded them and formed a large bagel or wheel. Meanwhile the mother, as she kept an eye on their four identical suitcases – the kind with retractable handles and plastic wheels – was worried that their luggage, being slightly larger than standard airport regulated carry-ons, would not be allowed on the plane, and at the moment, all she wanted was her Prozac and a cigarette.

All of this was occurring in the northeast quadrant of the food court, directly opposite from where Donny Foster was sitting next to Emporio Rulli's half dome display of pastries and the scent of fresh brewed coffee. He was trying to read a book called Total Enlightenment, but found himself unable to concentrate. His palm and fingers were pressed down on the yellowed pages and further creased the spine, while his head, freshly shaved and smooth like a peach, was tilted to the left and resting against his other hand.

Donny Foster looked up, glancing at the two boys who were walking on the guardrails and steadily making their way into the northwest quadrant of the food court. From his own childhood memories, he presumed that they were playing a game in which the objective was to avoid touching the ground because it was lava or something equally dangerous. But now, as an adult and college grad, he found the premise rather pointless.

In two hours his plane would be leaving for Beijing, where he would backpack across China in search of a Buddhist monastery, preferably in the mountains or anywhere secluded, anywhere away from desire, and although he recognized the hypocrisy of his intentions – to join a sangha and become a Bhikshus – he reasoned that this last act of desire was necessary because without guidance, he would never achieve enlightenment. This was the extent of his plan, all the minor details would be filled in later; he figured the money – five thousand US dollars from his savings account – would solve any potential problems. He preferred things this way, a concrete plan would only bring to light complications and holes. Plus there was no turning back now, not after defaulting on his student loans.

Donny watched as the mother reclined into the polypropylene seat back - which was curved like the head of a spoon or contact lens – and began to chew on her cuticles, clearly agitated. She glanced in his direction and then hastily pulled her index finger away from her mouth. She proceeded to open Lonely Planet: Thailand's Islands and Beaches, which had been lying on the table – next to the salt shaker and napkin dispenser – for over half an hour with a bookmark inserted near the middle.

Lesa Duras, his girlfriend, walked into the north food court and surveyed the dining area. When she saw Donny, she smiled, her lips pressed together in a subtle arch.

He pretended not to notice, holding back the urge to grin. It was unmistakably her, the only girl who had the round pale face of someone immune to the California sun, and hair that fell in gentle waves to her waist.

Lesa took a seat across from him and said, 'Donny, this is stupid. This is really stupid.'

'How did you know I was here? I sure didn't tell you.'

'Your mother told me. This morning in fact,' Lesa said, 'You could've told me at least, like any sensible person would've done.'

'No, you're wrong. A sensible person would leave without saying a thing. It would've been selfish of me to tell you. You know why? Because we'll have to say goodbye and everything. It's selfish really. I mean, sure, it's depressing, but at the same time we feel loved, cared about. And since there's no changing my mind, this only benefits me, you know.' It was true that Donny wanted to disappear without a word, to the extent that he would under no circumstances send letters to friends and family once he arrived in Beijing, but the problem was that he found himself unable to suppress his desire to be loved and wound up telling his mother, based on the assumption that, even after he had made it clear that no one else should know, she would tell Lesa.

'It's okay. I want to say goodbye. Even if you think it's selfish. Which it's not, Donny. And why are you doing this anyway? Tell me.'

'Do you want something to eat? Some coffee maybe?'

'No! Why are you changing the subject on me all of a sudden?'

'Well, I'm hungry. I haven't had a thing to eat all day, except those raisin cookies you made for me a week ago. I don't know where you got the idea that I liked raisins in the first place.'

'What? A month ago you said you loved raisins. Remember at the farmer's market? Oh, I'm sure you remember that really beautiful Swedish girl, the one handing out those tiny boxes of raisins, the one wearing the red bonnet, the one who looked nothing like the 'Sun-Maid girl'. Christ, they could have at least picked a brunette, one with smaller breasts too.'

'Yes, I remember all of that. But I never said anything about loving raisins. Look, I'm gonna order some food, and then I'll tell you, maybe.' Donny stood up and walked to Lori's Diner, weaving around chairs and tables. He had tried to smile before he left, but by then, he had lost any desire to do so. It made him sick that he had even entertained the idea of faking one just to please her.

Lesa smiled at the two boys who had now entered the southwest quadrant of the food court and who had, by now, established a nice rhythm in their footwork, first sliding the right foot forward, then the left. They kept balance by holding onto and leaning against the uppermost rail. And apparently it wasn't lava they were afraid of, but radioactive waste that had been expelled from a nuclear power plant in Russia or something of that nature.

Throughout the day, Donny had felt hunger pangs and a weakness of mind which had made him drowsy, and now, as he scanned the menu, everything appeared to be screaming, 'Eat me! I'm delicious! Eat me! You'll feel better! Eat me!' The 'Lori's Burger' and 'New York Steak Sandwich', in particular, were making excellent arguments, and had he not decided to become a vegetarian today, he would've chosen one or the other, though not after a few minutes of indecision and wishing that he could try both and wondering if he should just go ahead and do it anyway. Instead Donny ordered something called 'The Planet', which, judging by the description, was a simple garden salad with avocados added. The name seemed to insinuate something more substantial, more grand, as if this plastic box of mixed greens and vegetables was the Earth. But what did that make him? A god? No, it wasn't possible, not when mind and body were illusory.

Returning to the table, Donny tried again to smile but only managed to nod his head. He put the salad down and popped open the lid. 'Is Thousand Island vegetarian?' Donny asked. He picked up a packet of dressing. His fingers were placed on opposite sides of the dotted line, where it depicted a pair of scissors and said 'Tear Here.’

'Does it matter?' Lesa rolled her eyes.

'Yes, if I'm going to be a vegetarian, I can't eat meat. Ah, forget it.' Donny tossed the dressing across the table. 'So I figure you want to know why I'm doing this. It's simple really. I'm sick of being selfish. I'm sick of suffering. I'm sick of seeking pleasure and more pleasure to sustain any semblance of happiness. Like when we went on that twenty mile hike in Redding. Remember? We misread the map and thought it was only five miles, and we chose the hottest most humid day to enjoy the mosquitoes and the bugs and nature, and along the way we saw that rattlesnake hissing and flicking its tongue at us and all you could think about was taking a picture, to capture its beauty, the ways its body danced like a sine wave, and we brought only three bottles of water and I was so thirsty that I wanted to lick the sweat off your body, and we walked until the soles of our feet started to blister at the heel, and when we reached the end, the clearing at the top of the mountain, we saw the sunset and watched it sink and disappear. I wanted that day to last forever. But it doesn't. It's only a memory now. One that'll fade away if I stop trying to remember. Once the moment is gone it's like it never happened.'

'You only have one life, Donny. Live it to its fullest. You don't want to be regretting it when you're old and alone and dying of cancer or something. What about your writing, and your novel? Are you just going to give up?'

'I don't see why not. See, that's the problem with everyone these days, even you. It's like the whole human race thinks they're some kind of higher being, bigger than god, bigger than whatever is bigger than god. Getting that story published in Harper's got to my head. I seriously thought I was going to be the next Dostoevsky. I thought my words would make me immortal. I thought it was destiny. I told everyone about it. But worst of all was how I went about doing this, never telling them directly, always being modest about it, pretending to be at least. Remember how I left that copy of Harper's on your desk that day? I left early, telling you that I had promised my mom that I would mow the lawn and paint the fence, but what I really did was spend the whole day sitting in my room and waiting for my cellphone to ring, to hear that polyphonic ring tone from some depressing Elliot Smith song that I can't remember anymore. I just stared at the ceiling with my arms splayed and hanging off the sides of my bed, and I knew it was useless to do anything other than lay there, and my head hurt, really hurt, not in the physical sense like a headache or migraine, it was more mental and it wasn't going away until you congratulated me.'

'Oh, come on. I knew all along what you were doing. It was so obvious. Face it, everyone's selfish. Even this whole idea of becoming a monk and spending all day meditating is selfish. It's all so contradictory, if you want my opinion.'

'But that's the thing. It's not selfish at all. That's what's so amazing about it.' Donny ate his salad, chewing in a slow methodical fashion. The lettuce and mushrooms in his mouth tasted dry and flavorless. 'It's based around the doctrine of dependent origination or Karma. It's brilliant really. Everything we do – including our thoughts – is considered a cause, and everything that happens to us is a result of these actions, so if you were to put an end to all causes, there would be no results, all dharma or phenomenon would cease to exist. All I'm saying is once you realize, and I mean truly realize, that there is no self, that everything in our world is void, there will be no such thing as ego.'

'Uh huh. Yeah. Brilliant.'

'Do you want my salad?' Donny stabbed his spork into a cherry tomato.

'Why don't you put dressing on it? I'm pretty sure there's no meat products in Thousand Island dressing. It's not going to kill you.'

'No, that's not it at all. It's just that the name of the salad is so egotistical and it makes me sick to think I'm eating it.'

'Oh give me a break. You're acting ridiculous now,’ Lesa said. 'Ah hell, I might as well just come out and say it. I always thought we were going to get married and live in the mountains where it was peaceful. So you could write and everything, and our two kids could learn to enjoy—'

'When did we get two kids?'

'Oh, come on. You know what I mean. Why do you have to make it so hard? I guess it's just a dream anyway. Forget it.'

'Exactly. Forget it. Look at that family over there. The mom probably has to take care of the kids all day and do all the housework, and now she's really looking forward to this trip to Thailand, her reward as she sees it. She thinks she'll feel wonderful and have the time of her life. And the father will probably spend the whole trip imagining himself as a foreign playboy who all the local women want to have sex with.'

'Stop. Stop.' Lesa lowered her voice and said, 'That's bullshit. You don't know them. That's not how it has to be. God, you talk like everyone is selfish and that no one can have compassion for others unless they adhere to Buddhism or whatever.'

'Well, it's true. I mean, I'm pretty sure they care about their children and that they will, albeit unwillingly, think of their children's desires first. But don't tell me they didn't consider a babysitter or sending them off to grandma and grandpa for two weeks. Everyday their minds are probably full of these selfish thoughts. That's not the right way to cultivate the Bodhi mind, all it causes is suffering. And as far as I'm concerned getting married and starting a family is the worst thing possible.'

'Okay. Okay. But not everyone's like that. Not everyone thinks like you,’ Lesa said. 'I still don't see how you could suddenly give up on your novel. You spent three years talking about and working on it. Sometimes I wanted you to shut up about it, just for one day about how complex and original your reverse linear plot arc worked and that it was nothing like Memento no matter how much I argued that it was or how this book was going to be so good that it would make the illiterate learn to read. A person can only stand so much.'

'I finished it.'

'That's it? You're just gonna let it sit in your computer now? Send it out to some agents and publishers at least.'

'I did, okay,’ Donny said, 'This is the last time I'm going to ask before I throw it away. Do you want my salad? I'd hate to waste it.'

'Well, what if the publishers accept it? Are you just going to give it to them free?'

'Yeah, sure. Anyway I better be going.' Donny stood up and picked up his book. 'I'm heading down to Boarding Area G. You can come with me to the security checkpoint if you want. I'd like you to though. Really.'

'Sure. We haven't said goodbye yet. But maybe we shouldn't. It's selfish right?'

Donny and Lesa headed to the security checkpoint. Both walked slow and deliberate like a summer sunset. If asked, Donny was prepared to tell Lesa that he was only going at this pace because she was and that he would really prefer that they walk faster.

The two boys were sitting down now, feet touching the ground. They were eating chow mein and Kung Pao chicken with disgusted looks on their faces. One of the boys was sticking his finger in his mouth and making vomit sounds. The father and the mother were reading the travel guide and pointing at anything that sounded fun or exotic. They planned to do all of those things and more.

'Here, you should read this. You'll like it.' Lesa handed Donny a copy of Franny and Zooey. 'Take it. Please.'

'Sure, I'll read it on the plane. I'm not making any promises though. I don't read for pleasure anymore. Sadly books have to end too. Don't you hate it, and at the same time love it, when you finish a really good book? I always wish that I could follow the characters' lives forever because I always get attached to them, almost as if they were real, and I guess you could consider them about as real as you or me.'

'I'm sorry. How dumb of me.'

'Please don't worry about it,' Donny said as they reached the security checkpoint. 'Well, this is goodbye.'

'Goodbye,' Lesa said.

Donny smiled and said, 'In the Tushita Heaven, they express and fulfill their desire for love by smiling at each other.'
