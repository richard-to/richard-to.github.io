title: "What I really do when I go jogging"
---

At five AM, Vernon West stood on the railroad tracks. He faced southbound to spot oncoming trains, even though the first was scheduled to pass by in half an hour, and even though he'd hear the horn and the pounding of steel on steel long before he stared into a headlight. He learned in the first week that standing with his back to the train increased his fear, like how when walking with a blindfold on, he expected to hit a wall after each step. That was the only thing he'd learned about Forest Bernard's suicide in the two weeks he'd been coming here.

He would never forget the hollow clunk when his train collided with Forest's body, sending him into the air like he was swimming the backstroke. He may have even looked graceful if not for the blood stains on the window. No one blamed Vernon. Not even Forest's parents, Laura and Thomas Bernard. They assured him that the circumstances were beyond his control. "You pressed the emergency brake. What else could you do?" Laura Bernard said.

Ever since the accident, Vernon couldn't sleep. He was afraid of this recurring dream where his daughter Rebecca and Forest Bernard were married and lived with their twin sons in a modest suburban townhouse. Rebecca coached a high school swim team after failing to realize her Olympic dreams and Forest booked trips for people to tropical islands and third-world countries. Escape was his theme. He focused on the banality of his customers' lives. In his office, posters depicted families laughing and smiling as they taught English in thatched huts, bungee jumped into bottomless valleys, and scaled mountains covered in snow.

A train horn sounded three times and the tracks rumbled. In the distance, a light. Vernon dared himself to hold his arms out and stand for three seconds, but his legs trembled and he ran onto the grass. He tripped over his foot. His wrists and face slammed against the damp earth. He breathed rapidly as the train sped by. The loudness. The metal heartbeat of the wheels grinding against the tracks. He could've sworn the sound came from him. But he didn't have a heart of metal. He knew to fear a train traveling at 100 mph. Forest Bernard was no coward and he controlled the direction of his life. That much Vernon knew now.

"Do you need a hand?" Laura Bernard stood in front of him with her hand out.

Vernon rolled onto his back. Grass and dirt stained his shirt. When he tried to stand up, Laura grabbed his wrist with both hands and pulled him up. She grunted softly.

"Thanks. My wife's going to wonder what kind of jogging I'm doing." He brushed the dirt off his pants.

Laura tiptoed and leaned her body close to him. He smelled her perfume. She pulled a yellow flower petal from his hair. She wavered and swayed and he prepared to catch her if she fell into his arms. She threw the wrinkled petal into the grass and looked up at him with her hands on her hips. "So what kind of jogging are you doing?"

"Not the kind you think."

"Can you promise me this has nothing to do with my son?"

"Look, this is the first time I've seen a freight train come this way at this time."

"So you run on train tracks?"

"No. But I could ask you the same thing. What are you doing here?"

Laura pointed to some crushed flowers.

"Sorry," he said. "How much? I'll pay you back."

"Come have dinner at my house tonight. Bring your wife if you want. We never gave you a suitable apology." She took a crumpled receipt and wrote her phone number and address.

The next morning Laura was planting flowers ten feet from the train tracks. She stood on her knees and packed fresh soil around the stems. She took off her straw sun hat and looked up at Vernon when she heard his footsteps. "Hey, you," she said.

"It's nice to know I'm not the only one who has trouble sleeping." He crouched down beside her. Small dirt clumps covered her palms and slender fingers. Her white capris were stained at the knees.

"Don't mind me. Go do your thing where you stand on the train tracks."

"Thanks for not telling my wife what kind of jogging I really do," he said.

Last night, at dinner, he'd been worried that Laura would reveal his secret, but all they had done was sit around the bar in the kitchen and eat salmon tacos and make small talk. His wife Marissa was the only one who'd asked a serious question. She'd wanted to know how their son was as a child. Thomas Bernard had said that Forest was adopted and then returned to his beer and tacos. That was all he'd said last night. Vernon wanted to punch him in the face. Just because his right leg was amputated up to his knee was no excuse for apathy. It had been sad to watch Laura lift her husband onto his barstool.

"You can trust me to keep a secret. And that goes for my salmon taco recipe too." Laura winked.

"The salmon tacos were great," Vernon said. His wife had found the meal inappropriate, "too fun given the circumstances," and on the way home she'd suggested that a pot roast with boiled vegetables would've been more fitting.

"It was nice not thinking about it for a few hours, wasn't it?" Laura said.

"My wife just glared at me when I said that. She doesn't understand us."

"She has a point too," Laura said sharply. She tried to half walk away and half stand up as if she were caught between two actions. She nearly fell onto her flowers. From his crouch, Vernon tried to reel her in by wrapping his arms around her waist, but luckily she regained her balance with a lunging step to the side. When she turned around, she looked surprised. Maybe she saw the concern on his face or found it funny to see his body frozen in an awkward rescue pose.

"I mean, look at us. We're out here again. We can't keep this up," she said.

"I know. I was thinking about it last night. How to stop my dreams."

"You never told me about any dreams. Is that why you don't sleep? What's so frightening about them?" Laura walked toward him. He thought she was going to hug him, but instead she held his hand briefly and let go. "I'm sorry about all this."

He told her about his dream where Rebecca and Forest got married. Laura was a good listener and he felt she understood what he found so haunting. His wife had tried to psychoanalyze him when he told her. "Maybe the dream signifies your desire to change the past, to rectify your perceived guilt in Forest's suicide," she'd said. But she was wrong.

"I come here every day," Laura said. "But I don't even know where he died. The police tried to tell me, but I pushed them away. I want to know now though."

"It's better if you don't know. We need more salmon tacos." He winked, but Laura just stared at the train tracks. The clean-up crew left no traces of a suicide. They could dig all they wanted to, but they would uncover no dinosaur bones and no ancient civilizations. Just dirt and grass.

Vernon pointed to the "No Trespassing" sign that the city had put up after the suicide. "He stood right there."

"Can you show me the exact spot? I want to stand where he stood."

He guided her to where he'd engraved the words "RIP FB" in the splintered wood. Laura's legs trembled as she stepped onto the tracks. They stood for a moment, facing southbound.

"How was he standing?"

"He held his arms out and closed his eyes. Like this." He lifted Laura's arms up and spread them wide, level to her shoulders.

"Forest was a fighter. He picked fights with anyone who made fun of his father. The school almost expelled him when he threw a basketball at a kid's face and broke his nose. I think Forest wanted his father's respect. But Thomas, he's just content to collect his disability checks. Sometimes I think he's just waiting to die. He was a different man before the motorcycle accident."

"Let's sit down before a train comes," he whispered.

She didn't budge, so he massaged her shoulders. She breathed heavily, her shoulders rising and falling. She lowered her head and he leaned closer to her, so he could see her face. Her eyes were closed and tears slid down her cheeks. He kissed her.

The dreams stopped after that, but he kept coming to the train tracks to see Laura. They would have sex in her station wagon and then have breakfast at Denny's. Over coffee and a Grand Slam, he'd tell Laura about how his life was dictated by obligations. He told her how he married his wife because he got her pregnant in his truck at seventeen. He told how he became a railroad engineer because his dad was a yardmaster in Sacramento and how he worked there in the summers unloading cargo and occasionally breaking up trains. And he told her how, for the last twenty years, he'd been focused on arrival and departure times and driving from San Jose to San Francisco and back.

One day he asked Laura if she wanted to go away with him for a week. They were sitting at Denny's, waiting for their breakfasts to arrive. He told her that he'd bought tickets to ride the California Zephyr to Chicago. They had reservations for the sleeper car. It was a two and a half day ride with a great view of the High Sierras and the Colorado River. And once they got to Chicago they could visit Navy Pier and Millennium park. And if they got hungry, they could stop at Gino's.

"You sound like a salesman," Laura said.

"Aren't you tired of the car?" he said.

"We can always rent a hotel room."

"If you're worried about my wife, she'll never know. I've already told her that my psychologist suggested that I do some sort of re-experiencing therapy."

Laura wrapped her hands around her coffee cup. She blew at the steam. "It's not that. You're a trustworthy man. You have that about you. That's why your wife still thinks you go jogging every morning."

"I'm not asking you to leave Thomas."

"I don't intend to. But there's no turning back if I go with you."

He stood up, placed a twenty on the table and put the train ticket in her hand. "I'll see you on the train tomorrow," he said, half asking and half demanding.

Laura put the crumpled ticket in her purse and nodded. She gave him some hope and he walked outside with the belief that he was in control of his life. For once he jogged home. Half an hour later, he crept into bed, sweating and feeling a soothing warmth surge through his body. He slept until two in the afternoon.

The next day he stood in front of the Emeryville train station with a duffel bag. He watched for Laura's station wagon to pull into the parking lot, but it never showed. The California Zephyr was scheduled to leave in ten minutes, and he debated whether he should go home or board the train. He called her cellphone but no one answered. He told himself that he was in control of his life. And so it was settled; he drove to Laura's house going twenty over the speed limit. He hadn't broken a traffic law since receiving a speeding ticket fifteen years ago, and here he was weaving around drivers and cursing them for no reason other than that Laura had stood him up.

The station wagon was not in the driveway when he arrived at her house. He walked up the porch stairs and knocked on the door anyway.

Thomas Bernard greeted him. Liver spots covered his wrinkled face. The skin on his cheeks sagged and looked bruised. His unkempt beard was speckled with gray hair. He looked like man on a train ride to Auschwitz. He wondered when the railroad had stopped symbolizing freedom and ambition. What happened to the ideals that made the Transcontinental Railroad possible? Where were the thousands of Chinese immigrants crossing the Pacific to work in the Golden Mountain?

"What is it?" Thomas coughed and cleared his throat. He spit at the floor boards.

"Is Laura home?"

"She's at work." The door was half closed, so only his face and amputated right leg showed. He kept one hand on the door knob. "Do you want to call her?"

"I have her number."

Thomas paused and then said, "She wanted me to send this letter to you. She's always trying to get me out of the house and do something. But I'll get it for you right now." A minute later he returned with the letter and handed it to Vernon.

The letter was sealed in a regular old envelope with a printed mailing address taped to the front panel. It smelled like fresh paper.

"So are you going to leave now?"

"Can you tell me the story of your leg?" Vernon folded the envelope in half and stuffed it in his pocket. "Motorcycle right?"

"Laura told you?"

"No, just a guess. I saw the photos of you riding your bike. You looked pretty bad ass back then. That's something my daughter's boyfriend says a lot. Bad ass."

"Yeah, I guess you could say that. I wasn't in a biker gang or nothing. I worked in the Home and Garden department at Sears for chrissakes. I sold tools and lawnmowers and exercise machines. Working on bikes and joy riding was just a hobby. But I loved it."

"…"

"I don't mean to bore you with my life's story. So I'll get to the point. The accident happened a few months before Forest was born. He wasn't adopted. I lied. But he wasn't mine either."

"And you found out?"

"Yeah, she was having an affair with some fancy suited lawyer. Ambulance chaser type though. He wasn't working any Supreme Court cases. Or even anything up in the Capital. Not even State affairs. Fucking Judge Judy shit if you know what I mean. I have to watch that every day because I can't stand soaps."

"You did something about it right?" Vernon stepped down a level on the porch steps.

"Damn right. I challenged him to a game of chicken on the 101. I'd ride my bike and he'd drive his BMW against traffic. I told him to meet me at three in the morning at the airport exit."

"He agreed to that?" Vernon stepped down another level so that he was on the concrete walkway and on even-level with the lawn.

"He called me a fuck nut. What does that mean? I still don't know." Thomas rolled out through the door. The sun hit his face and he squinted. He shielded his eyes with the back of his hand. With his other hand, he turned one of his wheels until he was on the edge of the porch.

"How do you get out? There's no ramp." Vernon looked to his left and right and then back at Thomas who was now eye-level.

"The problem is not getting out. But getting back in."

"…"

"Let me get back to the story. The lawyer didn't show up. I waited maybe half an hour. And I'm tired at this point. The Red Bull's edge is wearing off. I've probably yawned half a dozen times. And then this thought hits me that the fucker's probably at my house with my wife who's pregnant with my child."

"So was Forest your son or not?"

"Truth is I don't know. Laura has always insisted he was mine. That was until he died. Then I could say what I wanted. That he was adopted or that half his genes belonged to a scumbag lawyer."

"You still haven't told me how you lost your leg."

"You can guess for yourself. I've told you all you need to know." Thomas turned his wheelchair around and rolled back into his house where the blinds were shut and the lights were off. The door closed.

Vernon walked back to his car. He considered not opening the envelope. He should throw it away. But he was curious and tore it open on the left edge. Inside he found no letter or even a picture, just a ticket to the Windy City.
