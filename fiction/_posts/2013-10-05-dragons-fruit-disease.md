title: "Dragon's fruit disease"

Journalists from all over ask me if it is true, the 'Nanking Incident.' They ask if the Imperial Japanese Army really massacred 300,000 civilians. And was it true that many of the victims were women and children? The phrasings of their questions make it clear. They want me to slander the good name of Japan. They want me to theatrically confess to phantom atrocities. They believe the exaggerations of the Chinese government because victim stories are more profitable. And it's not like the Chinese don't have a motive of their own. How many millions in reparations will they receive on false accusations of genocide and rape?

The most persuasive evidence against these lies is the fact that the total population in the Nanking Safety Zone was only 200,000. You can read John Rabe's letters to the Japanese Embassy if you want proof. And I'm not denying that good and innocent people died. Not at all. I would be a fool to say so. Death is a by-product of war just like the pollution from your factories.

Imagine that you are soldier, a young nationalistic one who has never killed nor ever intends to kill a real-live human being. And now imagine you are face-to-face with a man so desperate to protect his family that he picks up a broomstick and begins to hit you with it. He completely ignores the pistol you hold to his forehead. He ignores your threats. You tell him you will shoot if he steps closer. You command him. What would you do? Would you let him pummel you until you keel over, curled up fetal? Or would you shoot him?

Most journalists refuse to answer. Others will offer alternative solutions. But no one chooses to shoot. And I tell them it is easy to say when you are sitting here drinking sake on the 91st floor of an apartment building in Okinawa. And here, this is when the journalists bring up that I murdered four women and two children under no provocation at all. 'How do you explain that?' they ask.

This is true. However the facts of the story have been distorted by the US media. It's all propaganda. These reporters want to smear Japan's proud face with their feces. Nowhere in the articles do they mention my addiction to dragon fruit or my friend Taro Matsumoto. And it was not 'cold blooded murder' as printed in the Times.

I am not obligated to relate my side of the story. But because I am a storyteller at heart, I cannot turn down the opportunity to flex my so to say literary muscles.

Now, depending on the disposition of the journalist, if I sense that he is keen to my sense of humor, I will begin with a brief anecdote about the origins of my dragon fruit addiction.

The first sign that something was wrong appeared upon birth. I had been crying with abnormal frequency, almost non-stop for two weeks. My parents tried sleeping pills, tea, rocking me in their arms, singing to me, softer pillows, thicker blankets. Nothing worked.

So my parents sought the expertise of the neurologist and Cartesian philosopher Dr. Yamamoto who ran a battery of tests and concluded that my mother had somehow disturbed my mental development as a fetus.

My mother began to cry quietly, her shoulders rolling like tiny tsunami waves.

Dr. Yamamoto wiped sweat off his forehead. He pretended to scratch his elbow and pivoted his foot like a windshield wiper.

My mother covered her face with her hands and tears streaked down her wrists like looping water slides. My father patted her on the shoulder.

Dr. Yamamoto cleared his throat and coughed. 'Did you witness or do anything unusual during pregnancy?' he asked.

She shook her head.

'There must have been something,' he said. 'You must understand that the fetus's attachment to the mother almost assures that some degree of corruption will occur in the unborn child's mind. The fetus feels the same sensations. The fetus feels the same passions.'

My father, who always thought in the monetary values of things, brought up that my mother did have a very expensive habit of eating dragon fruit for every meal.

'That's it!' the doctor said. 'That must be it.' He rushed to the phone and requested that a nurse purchase and bring some to room 113. 'Make it quick, ok? Tell them this is in the name of science.'

Moments later a nurse arrived with pureed dragon fruit. She squeezed my lips open like a funnel and then gave me a few spoonfuls. And just like that my crying stopped. I no longer flailed my tiny limbs like a turtle on its shell.

Dragon fruit, if you do not know, is a type of epiphytic cacti found in South America and Malaysia. The green leaves, which curl and protrude from its body like a diseased heart, give it a menacing and defensive look. Conversely, its exotically colored skin appear seductive and sensuous. Imagine the blends of pink and red found on the inside of a strawberry. If I go more than one day without the dragon fruit's sock-lint gray and gelatinous flesh I will suffer serious anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, restless leg syndrome, and a tendency for violent rages. Although I call them withdrawal symptoms, it is more accurately a description of my natural state of being. I understand it more as a mental disorder like clinical depression or neurasthenia.

I met Private Matsumoto when I joined the Imperial Japanese Army. The IJA had assigned him to deliver my weekly crate of dragon fruit. He drove a Type 97 motorcycle with a motorized carriage. I could not believe how close our engineers had come to replicating a Harley Davidson. What tenacity and know-how Japan showed back then. I was 19 and proud.

'It's better than Harley Davidson,' Matsumoto said. 'Give it a try and you'll see.'

Every Saturday we enjoyed tête-à-têtes on the barracks' roof. Matsumoto was gaunt and haggard with jutted cheek bones, a sucked in jaw, and abnormally large eyes. I avoided eye-contact when we talked. Instead I stared into the horizon in search of burning buildings. This was the aftermath of Chiang Kai-shek's 'Scorched Earth' policy which had sent Chinese soldiers into a frenzy of pyromania and looting.

'Do you want a cigarette? You can pay me back by stealing a pack or two from the supply depot.'

Matsumoto shook his head.

I was surprised that he declined. I knew some soldiers who were serious addicts, the kind who checked the pockets of the dead and who stuck up refugees in the Safety Zone. But everyone in my battalion smoked at least a little.

'It's bad for your health,' was Matsumoto's reason for not smoking. 'My father died from lung cancer. The doctors said it was because of his heavy smoking.'

I was a proud advocate of smoking at the time. It was just a different era. And a lot of information we have now I didn't know then. Matsumoto was a pioneer in this regard.

'So you never tried it?' I asked.

'Never in my life,' he said.

I started to really pressure him with these childish insults I learned in high school. I just really wanted him to try it. I wanted to affirm my actions or something. I even stuck a cigarette between his lips, which he spit out like some foreigner eating day-old Sashimi.

'You should relax, Taro. We are in war. We could be shot at any moment.' I picked up the cigarette and pocketed it for later. It was my last one.

'I think about it sometimes,' Matsumoto said. 'But then I think about my father. He spent all his free time smoking. He would lock himself in his office and sit there like a limp piece of unagi for hours at a time. On some days, smoke would seep through the door in these wispy tentacles. The tobacco smell would linger on the walls for weeks.'

I said nothing and took in the panoramic view of the city at night.

Matsumoto was infatuated with death. He did not go a single conversation without mentioning it some form or another. Once he asked if I would prefer to die by drowning or by being burned alive.

'I do not feel like talking about death tonight,' I said. 'I don't even want to think about it.'

Earlier that day I came across a young man loitering along the walls of Ginling College, which was a refugee camp for women and children. Actually a fellow compatriot used to sneak over the walls at night and partake in consensual intercourse with some of the women there. And before you even think it, these women did so willingly, because you see, this soldier happened to be incredibly handsome, and under different circumstances he would have become a model or actor who could land small parts with his freakish attractiveness alone.

But so this young man; he was Chinese and protocol was to inspect his shoulders for knapsack or rifle butt marks. He shrugged and took off his shirt. No marks, just a few clusters of pimples and fading mosquito bites.

'Turn around,' I said.

He faced the wall and pressed his hands and forehead against the stone bricks. He moved his arms and head smoothly and slowly like a construction crane transferring buckets of dirt. And he was so quiet and obedient that I thought he was for sure with the Red Spear Society. How could innocence be so calm? It was not possible, so I shot him. I blame the Chinese soldiers for creating this environment of paranoia. These cowards went as far as beating up their countrymen and stealing their clothes. The ones with no shame at all just stripped down to their underwear and burned their uniforms.

'Just answer the question,' Matsumoto said. 'Water or fire?'

'Drowning then.' I shrugged. Water always gave me the impression of tranquility and peace.

'My friend Hiroshi almost drowned once,' Matsumoto said. When Hiroshi was sinking to the bottom of this public pool in Tokyo, he thought that he would fall forever and began to panic. He flailed his arms and legs in an attempt to grab hold of something. Water stung his eyes and ears. Air pressed outward against his lungs and throat. His abdomen tightened, released slightly, and tightened further. It was like what happens when you hold your breath for too long except worse. And when Hiroshi could not hold his breath any longer he swallowed a mouthful of water, coughed it up, and swallowed some more.

'Does that sound peaceful?' Matsumoto said. 'For me, I would like to be burned alive. There's nothing like the sensation of having all your nerves inflamed, to feel something to its fullest extent, even pain. Basically to feel really truly alive is all I want.'

I did not understand what he meant until a member of the Red Spear Society killed him late in January of 1938. A sniper got him. He was shot in the head and his Type-97 swerved into a wall and exploded.

That night I sat on the roof and smoked a whole week's ration of cigarettes, one after another until the last stick burned down to black embers, the ashes of the dead drifting into the bonfire sky.

Private Fukazawa was Matsumoto's replacement. He delivered my dragon fruit in an armored truck and wore a helmet and body armor and carried a pistol.

'What happened to the motorcycle?' I asked.

He laughed. 'We're in the middle of a war.'

After he left, I dropped the crate of dragon fruit at Ginling College.

The next morning I could not get out of bed and vomited multiple times into a tin bucket. I tried closing my eyes but the RLS made sleep impossible. I complained all day about the electricity surging through my legs. I kicked and shook my feet for relief. And when night came I started randomly shouting nonsense and profanities.

On January 28, 1938, Mr. Sungan of the Special Service Corps of the IJA in Nanking announced the eviction of refugees from the Safety Zone. Planes distributed fliers which depicted a handsome soldier giving candy to a Chinese girl who had her hands cupped together and a large happy smile. The caption said, 'Return to your homes! Japan brings candy for children and food for everyone else!'

At this time my withdrawal symptoms had subsided a bit and I was deemed well enough to join the welcoming committee. Basically I was tasked with going building-to-building and evicting any families I found. This was how I encountered the four woman and two children. I found them in an abandoned house. The six of them were wrapped in a large blanket of which outlines of tiny bodies and heads were visible.

'It's a beautiful day,' I said. 'Why don't you come out and take a walk? The sun's out for the first time in days.'

No one moved. They just stared at me. A good two minutes passed before they blinked. It did not occur to me that maybe they did not understand Japanese. So I pulled out my pistol.

Now they understood. The women rose in unison. Their similar heights made it appear rehearsed and even comical. The blanket dropped from their shoulders and crumpled over the two children. For a few minutes these two protrusions meandered in circles, struggling to wade their way out. One-by-one I led them to the roof.

At this point most journalists have heard enough. They know what happens next and they finish the story for me. They say, 'And this is where you set the building on fire, right?'

When the journalists are gone and I am all alone with my gramophone records and nihonga paintings, electricity will surge through my legs and I will punch the walls with my arthritic hand until the neighbors complain.
