After telling a co-worker to hitch a ride back to Vietnam, Rosco, who was in the midst of savoring a rye bread, pastrami and jalapeño sandwich, was confronted by his manager and forced to enroll in racial sensitivity training. It wasn’t just that he told this co-worker to return in the rickety boat that had smuggled him into the United States in the first place, but that he continued on by saying that he better rub his jade Buddha’s belly for luck because this time he would be hard-pressed to survive the starvation, torrential rain, sharks and Thai pirates ready to pillage and rape him.

Rosco found his punishment unjust because he had intended the comment to be a joke, maybe an insensitive one, but a joke nonetheless. After the manager left, Rosco picked up a jalapeño by the stem and watched it bob up and down. The coat of sulfate made the skin glisten under the lights. He thought it resembled a shriveled tongue and when he bit into it, memories of the Vietnam War rushed through his mind like the tang of sulfates drenching his mouth.

The very next Sunday, Jimmy Trong Lam, who had escaped from Vietnam on a small fishing boat and who had found himself in America after a year-long wait in a Malaysian refugee camp, introduced himself to Rosco as his racial sensitivity trainer. He suggested that they get to know each other over lunch at a restaurant in Little Saigon, a proposal that Rosco scoffed at by saying, "Look, Jimmy, this ain't some blind date. This is a fucking racial tolerance program. All I'm gonna do is sit through your bull so I can get back to work, same as ever."

Inside the restaurant, an oscillating pedestal fan whirred in the corner. The flame retardant leaves of an artificial dracaena trembled. A few waitresses dressed in teal polo shirts darted around from customer to kitchen. Occasionally they exchanged smiles and a few words with each other. Music played softly from small speakers. Currently, an 80's style guitar solo saturated in reverb and too much chorus. When the solo faded out, the sensual voice of a female singer entered.

Rosco took a seat across from Jimmy. The mocha brown hair of his toupee looked almost natural if not for his black eyebrows. His horn-rimmed glasses threatened Rosco with a sense of intellectual superiority, and the silhouette of his polo shirt exposed a bulging belly that looked awkward on his otherwise slim frame. A beam of sunlight shone through the window, illuminating Jimmy's face.

"Rosco, my friend, have you ever had phở before?"

A simple 'yes' escaped Rosco’s lips. He held back the memories that surfaced, the humid days drinking Ba Muoi Lam, eating rice noodles drenched in thick pig fat, and telling embellished war stories.

"It is very good is it not? A lot of people, they say they don't like chicken liver with their phở, but I think it is tasty, especially with hoisin sauce and even a little Sriracha. But that is not really a Vietnamese condiment. It comes from the Thai actually," Jimmy said.

A smiling waitress placed two teacups and a tin teapot on the table.

"It is amazing to me how in America all these people come together and create something like Chinese hotpot, Korean Bulgogi, or the Swiss Fondue."

Jimmy wiped both cups with a napkin, filled one with tea, and proceeded to slosh the amber liquid back and forth between the two cups. Then he took two pairs of chopsticks and twirled them in his tea before drying them with another napkin. "When I was in Vietnam, you know, you go to a restaurant and you cannot be too sure if they cleaned the bowls and eating utensils. It saves water or if they did use water they may have reused it over and over again. But now there is no point here in America. They have safety rules to protect you now, but still there is a part of me that is stuck in the past ways of my life." Jimmy placed a pair of chopsticks and a napkin in front of Rosco, who had raised the menu in front of his face. "Like you go into these restrooms here and they now have little signs reminding people to wash their hands, and it is in all languages: American, Mexican, Vietnamese, Chinese, and on and on. Some even have French. I remember seeing it once somewhere. Yes, at this French restaurant actually."

A waitress walked in front of the table and pulled a notepad from her fanny pack. Rosco ordered the phở tái, pointing at the picture on the menu and reiterating that he wanted a large and not a small.

Jimmy asked about chicken livers, but the waitress rebuffed him, "No chicken liver here. No one like it."

"Chicken livers are a staple and if you do not have them, then this is BS," Jimmy said. "But okay, I’ll have the Bún Gà Nướng."

After she left, he mumbled, "Serves me right for taking you to a chain. Mom and Pop is much better, but I was afraid it may not seem sanitary enough for you."

Rosco reminisced about sleeping in the jungle and under the stars on nights where enormous rain drops splashed against his makeshift poncho tent. Wet dirt would cake his face and entangle in his hair as he lay shivering.

"Just to let you know, my name is not Jimmy Trong Lam, but Lam Trong Dung and you can probably guess why I changed it. When I came to America, my first job interview was at a casino in Las Vegas. I was applying to be a bus boy and took this opportunity very seriously. I wanted to answer his questions perfectly, but every time he said 'Dung', he would stop mid-sentence, breaking into this wild laughter and I did not know why until I checked the dictionary. I still remember the definition very clearly. The excrement of animals, manure, something foul or abhorrent," Jimmy said.

"Dung, huh? You that insecure about yourself that you have to change your name? Where's your pride, man?"

"I am ashamed a bit about that. But I am in America now and I want to fit in with your society and being named 'Dung' makes me unwanted, disliked, the butt of jokes. And it does not help that I do not look like an American."

"Look on the bright side Dung, at least you aren't named like this poor Vietnamese guy I met during my tour. His name was Dong Manh Nguyen. Dong Man we called him, and a few of us soldiers were gonna mess him up good for taking some of our C-rations and he told us his name and we ended up laughing our asses off and that sneaky bastard snuck off."

"Yes, I am glad my name is not Dong. In Vietnamese it means winter and that seems a bit like a girl's name to me, but it is a boy's for a reason I do not know. And for one dollar you can get 15,916 Dongs, minus exchange fees."

Rosco chuckled. "Good, glad you have a sense of humor about things. Some people, they take shit too seriously and they don't get that I'm just joking. That's how I get stuck doing some racial tolerance crap instead of spending my Sunday watching the Raiders and having a beer."

The waitress carried a plastic tray. Her fingernails, shaped like bullets, long and silver, clasped onto the ends, holding it steady so the broth would not slosh out of the bowl. Rosco watched her. She was middle-aged with dark eyes, long lashes and graying hair that she pulled back and tied in a ball that revealed her ears.

She placed the food on the table and scurried back to the kitchen, Rosco following her with his eyes until she disappeared into the smoke and aroma of beef broth bubbling in pots and that familiar, yet unfamiliar language of hers. "You know, that waitress reminded me of this funny story that happened to me on my first mission."

"Tell me about it," Jimmy said as he poured fish sauce into his bowl. He used his chopsticks to mix the grilled chicken with the vermicelli noodles, lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumber.

The pungent odor infiltrated Rosco's nostrils as he told his story.

By morning, Rosco and his squad had reached the hamlet in Tay Ninh, which consisted of three small thatch hooches, a stone well, and a fire pit that resided in the center. Rosco figured there were about twenty people living in those hooches. Women and children mostly, plus a few old men.

Supposedly, there was a weapons cache in the vicinity, a deduction made by a helicopter pilot, who reported enemy fire a few days back. Somewhere along the army's complex hierarchy, one of the higher-ups had believed the pilot's story and ordered an immediate investigation.

"The Puzzler's just a fucking Riddler rip-off. Have you noticed they both leave clues after the crime scene?" Rosco took a sip from his canteen in an attempt to quash his cigarette cravings that had grown exponentially since last night. The ambush didn't help matters much either. It had sent him into an almost paralyzing fear, made him lie on the ground with his hands over his head until he regained his composure. Stress and anxiety had a way ratcheting the intensity of his nicotine cravings.

"Yeah, that's true, but there are some huge differences between them. You're just not pointing out those differences. For example, the Puzzler is more into aviation. And I don't see the Riddler quoting Shakespeare," said Benny.

Sergeant Holloway ordered his soldiers to corral the villagers and place them around the fire pit. Rosco made his way to the well, where he had spotted a woman who stood crouched on her knees like a mantis and washed her clothes in a plastic tub without soap. She watched him approaching from the corner of her eye as she twisted a mass of damp fabric, but made no attempt to run, and this acceptance of fate befuddled him, for he was in complete control of the situation, yet her composure undermined his self-image, that of a highly trained killing-machine with the ability to provoke fear in everyone who stepped in his path.

"Hey Ralphy, you ever watch Batman?" asked Rosco.

"Yeah, I have," said Ralphy.

"Let me ask you something. Fucking Benny here is saying that the Puzzler is not a fucking Riddler clone. What you think, man?"

"Yeah, I guess so. Wasn't the Puzzler originally a character in Superman? No doubt Superman's answer to the Riddler. But you know what, Frank Gorshin is just great as the Riddler."

"Gorshin ain't playing the Riddler anymore, man. Pissed me off when I saw the new guy. I nearly trashed my television," said Rosco.

Benny stood around watching them, a gesture that irked Rosco and fueled his stereotypical view of the wealthy. He had always pictured his type in a mansion, eating caviar and frog legs served by tuxedoed servants with wire mustaches. The symbols of wealth, far from his reach, whittled away at his pride, the more he realized that brute strength and courage meant less and less in the Real World. At least here, it had some value.

"Prod her Benny. Stop shamming, you lazy fuck. Do it like you would cattle. Like this." With the muzzle of his M-16, Rosco jabbed the woman's shoulder a few times and knocked her to the ground. Wet dirt clung to her palms. Frayed strands of hair veiled her brown eyes. "You paying attention, Benny? Just like that. Easy."

"What? Gorshin quit? The show's never gonna be the same without him. Man, I've been away from the Real World for a year and fucking Gorshin quit. I don't know if I can handle the Real World anymore," said Ralphy.

Rosco took hold of the woman's wrist and yanked her off the ground. Her wrist was so skinny that his fingers wrapped around and touched his thumb. "What do you mean by not being able to handle the Real World?"

"Just feels like, after spending nearly a year here, the world's moved on without me. Batman is just a fucking television show, but it's changed and moved on and it bothers me. I can only imagine how it's gonna be like to see my girlfriend and my family. They'll have changed, moved on. How am I gonna handle that, if I can't even handle a change in Batman?" said Ralphy.

"Can't be that different."

The twenty villagers huddled together by the fire pit. Children hugged the legs of their mothers. Bodies browned from having the sun shining over them all the time. Eyes stared at the soldier's guns and mouths quivered.

"Someone tell me where the weapons cache is. Make it quick. I don't have all fucking day," said Sergeant Holloway. "No speak English? No? I figured as much. Should learn, enlighten yourselves for once."

Sergeant Holloway barked in Vietnamese. No one moved. No one said a thing. Unless one counted the crying or whimpering children. He paced around. Sneered at them. When he walked in front of the woman (the one who had been washing her clothes), he snatched her by the wrist. He jerked her out of the group. It surprised Rosco that her arm wasn't torn off.

"Rosco, get up here. Point your sixteen in her ear," said Sergeant Holloway. He formed a gun with his hand and stuck his index finger in her ear.

Rosco hesitated for second and walked up to her, watching her try to pull free. He placed the muzzle of the gun into her ear. His finger quivered on the trigger. Adrenalin rushing through his body.

It was back and forth. Sergeant Holloway would yell and she'd say something back, her voice unwavering, polite and angry at the same time. Rosco wished he knew what they were saying.

"Okay, enough of this bullshit, shoot her, Rosco. I'm giving you to the count of three. Okay?" said Sergeant Holloway. "One."

Rosco's hands trembled, causing the gun to whip her head to the side. She closed her eyes, clenched her jaw. Rosco smirked, deciding to let her agonize over the situation.

"I think that is enough, Rosco. This is not funny," said Jimmy.

"What? At least let me finish. I'm almost to the end." Rosco had been completely absorbed. He felt as if someone had just jerked him out of a dream.

"I am pretty sure I know what happens and I do not think that is funny. I am going to go pay the bill and then I think we should leave." Jimmy rose from his seat, nodded his head, and made his way to the cash register. He wore a fake Rolex and Gucci loafers that softly slapped the floor, almost in rhythm to the drumbeat and yet another 80's style guitar solo, attempting something similar to Van Halen's "Eruption".

After Jimmy paid the bill, he and Rosco headed for the exit. Two men in their early twenties and of Vietnamese descent entered at the same time. One of them brushed into Rosco, an accident.

He would have let it go had it not been for the shirt he was wearing, a small white shirt with an image of Ho Chi Minh's face, smiling.

The man acted as if nothing happened and walked to the counter with intentions of flirting with one of the waitresses, who was already beaming at his presence.

Rosco grabbed his shoulder and turned him around. He got a glimpse of his face: mustache fuzz, acne blemishes on his cheeks, and spiked hair, shiny under the fluorescents.

He tugged the man’s shirt, pulled him forward. The smell of peppermint and a vague hint of onions wafted into his nose. He raised his fist, clenched tight, shaking; the effects of arthritis taking hold. Bluish veins bulging under his sagging skin.

Jimmy grabbed Rosco’s arm. "Calm down; calm down. It is over now and has been for a long time. Let’s go."

Reluctantly, Rosco loosened his grasp and lowered his head. The man, breathing in deep gasps and grabbing his reddened neck, glowered at Rosco. His friend urged him to just let it go; he was just an old man.

"Come on, Rosco. I will drive you home."

Outside, Jimmy and Rosco stood before the afternoon sun, a ninety degree day and humid. Their eyes squinted, adjusting to the brightness. They stepped into a beat up Honda hatchback.

The engine revved and Jimmy drove Rosco home. Fuzzy dice hung from the rear-view mirror and a porcelain cat with one paw, raised as if scratching its ear, stared forward with enlarged pupils.
