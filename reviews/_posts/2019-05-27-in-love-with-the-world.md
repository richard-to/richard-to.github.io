title: "In Love with the World"
---

*In Love with the World* by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche is a surprising mix of the memoir and Buddhist self-help. I've read my share of both genres. In terms of memoir, they tend to be written by foreigners learning to become monks, such as *The Empty Mirror: Experiences in a Japanese Zen Monastery* by Janwillem Van De Wetering or *Zen Confidential: Confessions of a Wayward Monk* by Shozan Jack Haubner. And in terms of self-help, I've read the usual suspects: Thich Nhat Hanh, Pema ChÃ¶dron, Shunryu Suzuki, etc.

In regards to *In Love with the World*, I was expecting to read a memoir. The idea of a monk setting out on a wandering retreat caught my interest. Maybe I'm weird, but I've always been drawn to the idea of becoming homeless and living a life outside the norm. Who's to say that the life advertised in America is the good life for everyone?

The book itself turns out to be more along the lines of the Buddhist self-help genre. Every part of his journey is a teaching moment. For instance when he is on the train to Varanasi, he performs mindfulness meditation and a body scan. The narrative conveniently digresses to describe how those meditations work.

On his journey, he talks often about how being outside in the real world is different from his comfortable life as a monk. He illustrates his human vulnerabilities and prejudices in a way that makes him human and which also serves to teach the reader.

Although I was sort of disappointed to find myself reading yet another Buddhist self-help book, I found myself appreciating his wisdom. I'd like to say it's because of the structure with its intermixed narrative, but the simple answer is that his teachings are clear and impactful. In particular he describes the concept of impermanence in ways that resonate with me.

I'll end this review with a few quotes from the book:

> What if we enter relationships knowing that the thrill of a new romance, or the excitement of a new business partnership, or the initial encounter with a spiritual mentor will not be the same as in the future as it is in the beginning? What if we expected new positive circumstances to change rather than wished they would stay the same? The train makes many stops. We do not try to prolong them, and we do not expect the train to stay in one place. It passes through many places just as we pass through the bardos. The bardos show us that everything is always in transition. (Mingyur Rinpoche 51)

The train is a great metaphor for impermanence. Thinking of life as a train makes sense. Things are always changing and it's a mistake to think they will stay the same forever.

> How can we live in a world with no certainty, where not one single entity remains dependable for even one second?...What would it take to perceive a tree as a process rather than an object, as a living-dying form that grows, ages, dies, and transforms? What about the person we love most, or...what about ourselves? (Mingyur Rinpoche 82)

I've always struggled with the lack of certainty in the world. I don't know how people can be so certain sometimes. It honestly makes me feel like an alien since so many things are uncertain yet the feeling I get from others is that many things are certain.

I also like the idea here of viewing something as a process rather than an object. A tree is a great example since it is a living thing, yet we can easily forget this and think of it as an inanimate object. And I think it's also easy to think of people as objects sometimes and forget their alive-ness, their people-ness.

> The Buddha's truth is that yes, life is suffering, and the nature of our life as we now know it is one of discontent, frustration, and dis-ease of all kinds, as long as we remain stuck in our misperceptions; but these misperceptions are not fixed--they are not bound to anything. Therefore, we have a choice. The avoidance of our inner demons--our fears of change and death, our rage and jealousy--only imbues these adversaries with greater power. The more we run away, the less chance we have of escaping. We must face suffering, move into it; only then can we become free from it. This is the first noble truth. (Mingyur Rinpoche 126)

I love this paragraph because he explains the nuances of the first noble truth well. It's easy to read "life is suffering" and then feel depressed or pessimistic. I've certainly interpreted the first noble truth that way. But I think the point is to face the truth. The only way to solve a problem is to know the problem.

> The biggest challenge to accepting the constancy of death and rebirth lies with our resistance to impermanence, and our hopeless attempts to hold in place what inherently changes. We often express the wish to let go of such disturbing emotions as jealousy, anger, or pride, or to transcend vanity or laziness. When we think of making changes, our minds often jump to these conspicuous examples; and after decades of repetition, these traits seem immutable, undefeatable, and we lack the confidence to undertake the work of letting them go. (Mingyur Rinpoche 245)

This is simply a great description of how impermanence can affect people. The idea of changing, but not being able to change. Why the resistance? Where does it come from? How do we get through that resistance? I wish I knew.
