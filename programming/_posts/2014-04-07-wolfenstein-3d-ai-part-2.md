title: "Wolfenstein 3D AI - Part 2: Helpful Links"
---

One of the purposes of this project is to apply what I've learned on a project that has no clear solution and or outcome devised by a teacher. Sometimes I hear people complain that they never used anything they learned as a Computer Science student. I don't think that's true. It's just a matter of creating opportunities where this knowledge becomes relevant and useful. While working on this project, I've had to go through a lot of resources to help solve various problems, so I thought I'd list them here.

- Read Lowe’s SIFT paper multiple times with a focus “scale-space extrema detection” and “keypoint localization” sections
  - Ideally, I want to implement SIFT from the ground up
  - [Link to Lowe's SIFT Paper](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf)
- Reread Section 4.1.1 - 4.1.3 in Szeliski book
  - [Electronic draft available here](http://szeliski.org/Book/)
- Read Chapter 6 in Davies CMV book
  - [Unfortunately need to buy book. It is available on Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Machine-Vision-Algorithms-Practicalities-ebook/dp/B007OS9B9C)
- Research on various SIFT implementations
   - [Source code for Open CV SIFT implementation](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/modules/nonfree/src/sift.cpp)
