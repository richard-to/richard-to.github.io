Thanks to the "Don't Break the Chain" method, I made decent progress on the game engine this week. Still not where I want to be, but I'm happy that I put in at least an hour each day this week. It definitely adds up and I'm finding it easier to get started. Ideally I'd work on this project out of sheer compulsion. Unfortunately that's just not how I work. Apparently the only option is to trick myself with a calendar full of red X's.

In terms of the game engine, I mainly worked on improving the character animation and scrolling the background. A good chunk of that time was spent drawing and redrawing all the frames for the animation. It's a slow process. But I've definitely made improvements in terms of quality. Here's a screenshot of what I have so far.

For the pixel art, I tried Inkscape, AeSprite and PixieEngine.com before stumbling upon [Pixen](http://pixenapp.com/). If you're on OSX, Pixen is definitely the way to go. Layer support is very helpful.

Reasons why I didn't choose the others:

- __Inkscape__: Not great for pixel art and unfortunately not too usable on OSX.
- __AeSprite__: Very buggy and crashed. Hard to use UI.
- __PixieEngine.com__: Pretty good editor and it's online. I drew the grass and cliff background tiles using it. Unfortunately there's no support for layers.

For the sprite sheet I'm using [TexturePacker Lite](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker). It makes generating sprite sheets incredibly easy. Huge time-saver.
